Over the last two summers of his life, we taped these conversations in California, at Skywalker Ranch, the home of his friend, George Lucas, whose movie trilogy Star Wars had been influenced by Campbell’s work. We talked about the message and meaning of myth, about the first storytellers, about love and marriage, gods and goddesses, religion, ritual, art and psychology. But we always came around to his favorite subject, the hero with a thousand faces. Why the hero with a thousand faces?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, because there is a certain typical hero sequence of actions, which can be detected in stories from all over the world, and from many, many periods of history. And I think it’s essentially, you might say, the one deed done by many, many different people.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Why are there so many stories of the hero or of heroes in mythology?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, because that’s what’s worth writing about. I mean, even in popular novel writing, you see, these the main character is the hero or heroine, that is to say, someone who has found or achieved or done something beyond the normal range of achievement and experience. A hero properly is someone who has given his life to something bigger than himself or other than himself.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;So in all of these cultures, whatever the costume the hero might be wearing, what is the deed?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, there are two types of deed. One is the physical deed; the hero who has performed a war act or a physical act of heroism ñ saving a life, that’s a hero act. Giving himself, sacrificing himself to another. And the other kind is the spiritual hero, who has learned or found a mode of experiencing the supernormal range of human spiritual life, and then come back and communicated it. It’s a cycle, it’s a going and a return, that the hero cycle represents.</p><p>But then this can be seen also in the simple initiation ritual, where a child has to give up his childhood and become an adult, has to die, you might say, to his infantile personality and psyche and come back as a self-responsible adult. It’s a fundamental experience that everyone has to undergo, where in our childhood for at least 14 years, and then to get out of that posture of dependency, psychological dependency, into one of psychological self-responsibility, requires a death and resurrection, and that is the basic motif of the hero journey, Leaving one condition, finding the source of life to bring you forth in a richer or more mature or other condition.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;So that if we happen not to be heroes in the grand sense of redeeming society, we have to lake that journey ourselves, spiritually, psychologically, inside us.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;That’s right. And Otto Rank, in his wonderful, very short book called The Myth of the Birth of the Hero, he says that everyone is a hero in his birth. He has undergone a tremendous transformation from a little, you might say, water creature. living in a realm of the amniotic fluid and so forth, then coming out, becoming an air-breathing mammal that ultimately will be self-standing and so forth, is an enormous transformation and it is a heroic act, and it’s a heroic act on the mother’s part to bring it about. It’s the primary hero, hero form, you might say.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;There’s still a journey to be taken after that.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;There’s a big one to be taken.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;And that journey is not consciously undertaken. Do heroes go out on their own initiative, or do they</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, there are both kinds. A very common one that appears in Celtic myths, of someone who had followed the lure of a deer or animal that he has been following, and then carries him into a range of forest and landscape that he’s never been in before. And then the animal will undergo a transformation, become the Queen of The Fairy Hills or something like that. That is one of not knowing what you’re doing, you suddenly find yourself in full career of an adventure.</p><p>There’s another one where one sets out responsibly and intentionally to perform the deed. For instance, when Ulysses’ son Telemachus was called by Athena, “Go find your father,” that father quest is a major hero adventure for young people, that is, the adventure of finding what your career is, what your nature is, what your source is. He undertakes that intentionally.</p><p>Then there’s one into which you are thrown and pitched; for instance, being drafted into the army. You didn’t intend it, you’re in. You’re in another transformation. You’ve undergone a death and resurrection, you put on a uniform, you’re another creature.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;So does the heroism have a moral objective?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;The moral objective is that of saving a people or saving a person, or saving an idea. He is sacrificing himself for something, that’s the morality of it. Now you, from another position, might say that something was something that should not have been realized, you know. That’s the judgment from another side. But it doesn’t destroy the heroism of what was done, absolutely not.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Well, that’s a different angle on heroes than I got when I was reading as a young boy the story of Prometheus, going after the fire and bringing it back and benefiting humanity, and suffering for it.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. I mean, Prometheus brings fire to mankind and consequently civilization. That’s, by the way, a universal theme.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, it is?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;The hero the fire theft theme with aó usually with a relay race after it. Often it’s a blue jay or a woodpecker or something like this, that steals the fire and then passes it to something else, and something else, one animal after another, and they’re burned by the fires as they carry it on. Well, that accounts for the different colorings of animals and so forth. It’s a worldwide myth, the fire theft.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Do these stories of the hero vary from culture to culture?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, it’s the degree of illumination or action that makes them different. There is a typical early-culture hero who goes around slaying monsters. Now, that is in the period of history when man is shaping his world out of a wild, savage, unshaped world. Well, it has another shape, but it’s not the shape for man. He goes around killing monsters.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;So the hero evolves over time, like most other concepts and ideas and adventures.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, he evolves as the culture evolves. Now, Moses is a hero figure in his ascent of the mountain, his meeting with Yahweh on the summit of the mountain, and coming back with the rules for the formation of a whole new society. That’s the hero act. Departure, fulfillment, return. And on the way there are adventures that can be paralleled also in other traditions.</p><p>Now, the Buddha figure is like that of the Christ; of course, 500 years earlier. You could match those two traditions right down the line, even to the characters of their apostles, of their monks, Christ, now, there’s a perfectly good hero deed formula represented there, and he undergoes three temptations: the economic temptation, where the devil says, “You look hungry, young man; change the stones to bread,” Jesus said, “Man lives not by bread alone, but every word from the mouth of God.” Next, we have the political temptation: he’s taken to the top of a mountain and shown the nations of the world, and says, “You can come into control of all these if you’ll bow to me.” And then, “Now, you’re so spiritual, let’s go up to the top of Herod’s temple and see you cast yourself down, and God will bear you up and you won’t even bruise your heels.” So he says, “You shall not tempt the Lord your God.” Those are the three temptations of Christ. In the desert.</p><p>The Buddha also goes into the forest, has conferences with the leading gurus of the day, he goes past them, He comes to the bo tree, the Tree of Illumination, undergoes three temptations. They’re not the same temptations, but they are three temptations, And One is that of lust another is that of fear, and another is that of social duty, doing what you’re told. And then both of these men come back, and they choose disciples, who help them establish a new way of consciousness in terms of what they have discovered there. These are the same hero deeds; these are the spiritual hero deeds ñ the Moses, the Buddha, Christ, Mohammed.</p><p>Mohammed literally, and we know this about him, he was a camel caravan master. But he would leave his home and go out into a little mountain cave that he found and meditate, and meditate, and meditate and meditate. And one day a voice says, “Write,” and we have the Koran, you know. It’s an old story.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes it seems to me that we ought to feel pity for the hero instead of admiration, So many of them have sacrificed their own needs.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;They all have.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;And very often what they accomplish is shattered by the inability of the followers to see.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. They come out of the forest with gold and it turns to ashes, That’s another motif that occurs.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;In this culture of easy religion cheaply achieved, it seems to me we’ve forgotten that all three of the great religions teach that the trials of the hero journey are a significant part of it, that there’s no reward without renunciation and without a price, The Koran speaks, “Do you think that you shall enter the garden of bliss without such trials as come to those who passed before you?”</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, if you realize what the real problem is, and that is of losing primary primarily thinking about yourself and your own self-protection. Losing yourself, giving yourself to another, that’s a trial in itself, is it not? There’s a big transformation of consciousness that’s concerned. And what all the myths have to deal with is transformation of consciousness. That you’re thinking in this way, and you have now to think in that way.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Well, how is the consciousness transformed?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;By the trials.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;The tests that the hero undergoes.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;The tests or certain illuminating revelations. Trials and revelations are what it’s all about.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Well, who in society today is making any heroic myth at all for us? Do movies do this, do movies create hero myths?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;I don’t know. Now, my experience of movies, I mean, the significant experience I had of movies, was when I was a boy, and they were all really movies, They weren’t talkies, they were black and white movies, And I had a hero figure who meant something to me, and he served as a kind of model for myself in my physical character, and that was Douglas Fairbanks. I wanted to be a synthesis of Douglas Fairbanks and Leonardo da Vinci, that was my idea. But those were models, were roles, that came to me.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Does a movie like Star Wars fill some of that need for the spiritual adventure, for the hero?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, perfect, it does the cycle perfectly. It’s not simple morality play. It has to do with the powers of life and their inflection through the action of man. One of the wonderful things, I think, about this adventure into space, is that the narrator, the artist, the one thinking up the story, is in a field that is not covered by our own knowledge” you know, Though it’s much of the adventure in the old stories is where they go into regions that no one’s been in before. Well, we’ve now conquered the planet, so there are no empty spaces for the imagination to go forth and fight its own war, you know, with the powers, and that was the first thing I felt, there’s a whole new realm for the imagination to open out and live its forms.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Do you, when you look at something like Star Wars, recognize some of the themes of the hero throughout mythology?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I think that George Lucas was using standard mythological figures. The old man as the adviser, well, specifically what he made me think of is the Japanese swordmaster.</p><p>(Clip from “Star Wars” )</p><p><strong>OBI WAN KENOBI:</strong>Remember, a Jedi can feel the force flowing through him.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve known some of those people, and this man has a bill of their character.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Well, there’s something mythological, too, isnít there, in the sense that the hero is helped by this stranger who shows up and gives him some instrument, a sword or a sheaf of light, shaft of light?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, but he gives him not only a physical instrument, but a psychological commitment and a psychological center,</p><p>(Clip from “Star Wars”)</p><p><strong>OBI WAN KENOBI:</strong>&nbsp;This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;When he had him exercising with that strange weapon, and then pulled the mask over, that’s real Japanese Stuff.</p><p>(Clip from “Star Wars”)</p><p><strong>DARTH VADER:</strong>&nbsp;I’ll take them myself.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;When I took our two sons to see it, they did the same thing the audience did; at that moment when the voice of Ben Kenobi says to Luke Skywalker in the climactic moment</p><p>(Clip from “Star Wars”),</p><p><strong>OBI WAN KENOBI:</strong>&nbsp;Use the force, Luke. Let go. Luke.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;The audience broke out into elation and into applause.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;“They did. Well, you see, this thing communicates. It is in a language that is talking to young people today, And that’s marvelous.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;So the hero goes for something, he doesn’t just go along for the ride. He’s not a mere adventurer.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, a serendipitous adventure can take place, also, You know, what the word serendipity comes from? Comes from the Sanskrit Swarandwipa, the Isle of Silk, which was formerly the name of Ceylon, And it’s a story about a family that’s just rambling on it’s way to Ceylon, and all these adventures take place. And so you can have the serendipitous adventure as well.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Is the adventurer who takes that kind of trip a hero in the mythological sense?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, He is ready for it. This is a very interesting thing about these mythological themes. The achievement of the hero is one that he is ready for, and it’s really a manifestation of his character. And it’s amusing, the way in which the landscape and the conditions of the environment match the readiness of the hero. The adventure that he’s ready for is the one that he gets.</p><p>(Clip from “Star Wars”)</p><p><strong>HAN SOLO:</strong>&nbsp;Look, I ain’t in this for your revolution and I’m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I’m in it for me.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;The mercenary, Solo, begins as a mercenary and ends up as a hero.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;He was a very practical guy, a materialist in his character, at least as he thought of himself. But he was a compassionate human being at the same time, and didn’t know it. The adventure evoked a quality of his character that he hadn’t known he possessed.</p><p>(Clip from “Star Wars”)</p><p><strong>PRINCESS LElA:</strong>&nbsp;I love you.</p><p><strong>HAN SOLO:</strong>&nbsp;I know.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;He thinks he’s an egoist, he really isn’t, and that’s a very lovable kind of human being, I think, and there are lots of them functioning beautifully in the world. They think they’re working for themselves, very practical and all, but no, there’s something else pushing them.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;What did you think about the scene in the bar?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;That’s my favorite, not only in this piece, but of many, many pieces I’ve ever seen.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Why?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, where you are is on the edge, you’re about to embark into the outlying spaces. And–</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;The real adventure.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;The real adventure. This is the jumping-off place, and there is where you meet people who’ve been out there, and they run the machines that go out there, and you haven’t been there. It reminds me a little bit in Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island, the atmosphere before you start off the adventure. You’re in the seaport, and there’s old salts, seamen who’ve been on the sea, and that’s their world, and these are the space people, also.</p><p>(Clip from “Star Wars”)</p><p><strong>HAN SOLO:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve got a bad feeling about this.</p><p><strong>LUKE SKYWALKER:</strong>&nbsp;The walls are moving!</p><p><strong>PRINCESS LElA:</strong>&nbsp;Don’t just stand there, try and brace it with something.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;My favorite scene was when they were in the garbage compacter, and the walls were closing in, and I thought, that’s like the belly of the whale that Jonah came out of.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;That’s what it is, yes, that’s where they were, down in the belly of the whale.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;What’s the mythological significance of the belly?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;It’s the descent into the dark. Jonah in the whale, I mean, that’s a standard motif of going into the whale’s belly and coming out again.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Why must the hero do that?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;The whale represents the personification, you might say, of all that is in the unconscious. In reading these things psychologically, water is the unconscious. The creature in the water would be the dynamism of the unconscious, which is dangerous and powerful and has to be controlled by consciousness.</p><p>The first stage in the hero adventure, when he starts off on adventure, is leaving the realm of light, which he controls and knows about. and moving toward the threshold. And it’s at the threshold that the monster of the abyss comes to meet him. And then there are two or three results: one, the hero is cut to pieces and descends into the abyss in fragments, to be resurrected; or he may kill the dragon power, as Siegfried does when he kills the dragon. But then he tastes the dragon blood, that is to say, he has to assimilate that power. And when Siegfried has killed the dragon and tasted the blood, he hears the song of nature; he has transcended his humanity, you know, and reassociated himself with the powers of nature, which are the powers of our life, from which our mind removes us.</p><p>You see, this thing up here, this consciousness, thinks it’s running the shop. It’s a secondary organ; it’s a secondary organ of a total human being, and it must not put itself in control. It must submit and serve the humanity of the body.</p><p>(Clip from “Star Wars”)</p><p><strong>DARTH VADER:</strong>&nbsp;Join me, and I will complete your training.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;When it does put itself in control, you get this Vader, the man who’s gone over to the intellectual side.</p><p>(Clip from “Star Wars”)</p><p><strong>LUKE SKYWALKER:</strong>&nbsp;I’ll never join you!</p><p><strong>DARTH VADER:</strong>&nbsp;If you only knew the power of the dark side.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;He isn’t thinking, or living in terms of humanity, he’s living in terms of a system. And this is the threat to our lives; we all face it, we all operate in our society in relation to a system. Now, is the system going to eat you up and relieve you of your humanity, or are you going to be able to use the system to human purposes?</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Would the hero with a thousand faces help us to answer that question, about how to change the system so that we are not serving it?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;I don’t think it would help you to change the system, but it would help you to live in the system as a human being.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;By doing what?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, like Luke Skywalker, not going over, but resisting its impersonal claims.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;But I can hear someone out there in the audience saying, “Well, that’s all well and good for the imagination of a George Lucas or for the scholarship of a Joseph Campbell, but that isn’t what happens in my life.”</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;You bet it does. If the person doesn’t listen to the demands of his own spiritual and heart life, and insists on a certain program, you’re going to have a schizophrenic crack-up. The person has put himself off-center; he has aligned himself with a programmatic life, and it’s not the one the body’s interested in at all. And the world’s full of people who have stopped listening to themselves. In my own life, I’ve had many opportunities to commit myself to a system and to go with it, and to obey its requirements. My life has been that of a maverick; I would not submit.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;You really believe that the creative spirit ranges on its own out there, beyond the boundaries?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I do.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Something of the hero in that, I don’t mean to suggest that you see yourself as a hero.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;No, I don’t, but I see myself as a maverick.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;So perhaps the hero lurks in each one of us, when we don’t know it</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, yes, I mean, our life evokes our character, and you find out more about yourself as you go on. And it’s very nice to be able to put yourself in situations that will evoke your higher nature, rather than your lower.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Give me an example.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;I’ll give you a story. I’m dealing with an Iroquois story right now. There’s a motif that comes in American Indian stories very often, what I call the refusal of suitors. A girl with her mother lived in a wigwam on the edge of the village. She was a very handsome girl, but extremely proud and would not accept any of the boys. They proposed to her through the mother, and the mother was terribly annoyed with her. Well, one day they’re out collecting wood, and they have gone a long way from the village. And while they are collecting the wood, a terrific darkness comes over them. Now, this wasn’t the darkness of night descending; when you have a darkness like that, there’s some magician at work somewhere. So the mother says, “Well, let’s gather some bark and make a little wigwam of bark, wigwam for ourselves, and collect wood for a fire, and we’ll just spend the night here.” So they do that, and the mother falls asleep.</p><p>And the girl looks up and there’s this magnificent guy standing there with a wampum sash, glorious, and feathers and all this kind-black feathers. He says, “I have come to marry you, and I’ll await your reply.” She accepts the guy, and the mother accepts the man, and he gives the mother the wampum belt to prove that he’s serious about all this. So he goes away with the girl; she has acquiesced. Mere human beings weren’t good enough for her, but here’s something that really– ah. So she’s in another domain.</p><p>Now, the adventure is marvelous. She goes with him to his village, and they enter his lodge. The people in there greet her and she feels very comfortable about it and all. And then the next day he says, “I’m going off to hunt.” So he leaves the lodge and the door is closed with a flap, there’s a flap. When he closes the flap, she hears this strange sound. So there’s the whole day and she’s just in the hut, and as evening comes, she hears that strange sound again. And the door flap is flung off and in comes this prodigious serpent with his tongue darting, and he puts his head in her lap, and says, “Now, you must search my head for lice,” and things like that, and she finds all kinds of horrible things there and kills them all. And then he withdraws, and in a moment after the door has been closed, it opens again and in he comes, he’s the same beautiful young man again, and said, “Were you afraid of me when I came in just now?” No, she says, she wasn’t at all afraid.</p><p>Next day he goes off to hunt, and then she leaves the lodge to gather wood. And the first thing she sees is an enormous serpent basking on the rocks. And then another, and then another, and she begins to feel very badly, very homesick and discouraged. Then the evening. the serpent and then the man again. The third day when he leaves, she decides she’s going to try to get out of this place. So she goes out and she’s standing in the woods thinking, and a voice speaks to her. She turns, and there’s a little old man there, and he says, “Darling, you are in trouble. The man that you’ve married is one of seven brothers. They are great magicians, and like many people of this kind, their hearts are not in their bodies. There’s a collection of seven hearts in a bag that is hidden under the bed of the eldest, to whom you are married. You must go get that, and then we’ll deal with the next part of the adventure.”</p><p>She goes in and finds the bag of hearts and is running out, and a voice calls after her. “Stop. stop.” It’s the voice of the magician. And she continues to run and he says. “You may think you can get away from me, but you never can.” And just at that point, she hears the voice of the old man, he says, I’ll help you, dear.” And he’s pulling her out of the water; she didn’t even know that she was in water.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;What does that say to you?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;That’s to say you have moved out of the hard land, the solid earth, and are in the field of the unconscious. And she had pulled herself into the transcendent realm and got caught in the negative powers of the abyss, and she’s being rescued now by the upper powers. What you have done has been to elevate yourself out of the local field and put yourself in the field of higher power, higher danger. And are you going to be able to handle it? If you are not eligible for this place into which you’ve put yourself, it’s going to be a demon marriage, it’s going to be a real mess. If you are eligible, it can be a glory that will give you a life that is yours, in your own way.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;So these stories of mythology are simply trying to express a truth that can’t be grasped any other way.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;It’s the edge, the interface between what can be known and what is never to be discovered, because it is a mystery transcendent of all human research. The source of life: what is it? No one knows.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Why are stories important for getting at that?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well. I think it’s important to live life with a knowledge of its mystery and of your own mystery, and it gives life a new zest, a new balance, a new harmony to do this. I mean, in therapy, in psychological therapy, when people find out what it is that’s ticking in them, they get straightened out. And what is it that life is. I find thinking in mythological terms has helped people, visibly you can see it happen.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;How, what does it do?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;It erases anxieties, it puts them in accord with the inevitables of their life, and they can see the positive values of what are the negative aspects of what is positive. It’s whether you’re going to say no to the serpent or yes to the serpent, as easy as that.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;No to the adventure?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. The adventure of being alive, of living.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;When I was growing up, tales of King Arthur, tales of the medieval knights, tales of the dragon slayers were very strong in my world.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Dragons represent greed, really. The European dragon guards things in his cave, and what he guards are heaps of gold and virgins. And he can’t make use of either of them, but he just guards. There’s no vitality of experience, either of the value of the gold or of the female whom he’s guarding there. Psychologically, the dragon is one’s own binding of oneself to one’s ego, and you’re captured in your own dragon cage. And the problem of the psychiatrist is to break that dragon, open him up, so that you can have a larger field of relationships.</p><p>Jung had a patient come to him who felt alone, and she drew a picture of herself as caught in the rocks, from the waist down she was bound in rocks. And this was on a windy shore, and the wind blowing and her hair blowing, and all the gold, which is the sign of the vitality of life, was locked in the rocks. And the next picture that he had her draw had followed something he had said to her. Suddenly a lightning flash hit the rocks, and the gold came pouring out, and then she found reflected on rocks round about the gold. There was no more gold in the rocks, it was all available on the top. And in the conferences that followed, those patches of gold were identified. They were her friends. She wasn’t alone, but she had locked herself in her own little room and life, but she had friends. Do you see what I mean? This is killing the dragon. And you have fears and things, this is the dragon; that’s exactly what’s that all about. At least the European dragon; the Chinese dragon is different.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;What is it?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;It represents the vitality of the swamps and the dragon comes out beating his belly and saying “Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.” You know, that’s another kind of dragon. And he’s the one that yields the bounty and the waters and all that kind of thing. He’s the great glorious thing. But this is the negative one that cuts you down.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;So what you’re saying is, if there are not dragons out there, and there may not be at any one moment.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;The real dragon is in you.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;And what is that real dragon?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;That’s your ego, holding you in.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;What’s my ego?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;What I want, what I believe, what I can do, what I think I love, and all that. What I regard as the aim of my life and so forth. It might be too small. It might be that which pins you down. And if it’s simply that of doing what the environment tells you to do, it certainly is pinning you down. And so the environment is your dragon, as it reflects within yourself.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;How do I slay…</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;How do you?</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Slay that dragon in me? What’s the journey I have to make, you have to make, each of us has to make? You talk about something called the soul’s high adventure.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;My general formula for my students is, follow your bliss, I mean, find where it is, and don’t be afraid to follow it.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Can my bliss be my life’s love, or my life’s work?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, it will be your life.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Is it my work or my life?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, if the work that you’re doing is the work that you chose to do because you are enjoying it, that’s it. But if you think, “Oh, gee, I couldn’t do that,” you know, that’s your dragon blocking you in. “Oh, no, I couldn’t be a writer, oh, no, I couldn’t do what so-and-so is doing.”</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Unlike the classical heroes, we’re not going on our journey to save the world, but to save ourselves.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;And in doing that, you save the world. I mean, you do. The influence of a vital person vitalizes, there’s no doubt about it. The world is a wasteland. People have the notion of saving the world by shifting it around and changing the rules and so forth. No, any world is a living world if it’s alive, and the thing is to bring it to life. And the way to bring it to life is to find in your own case where your life is, and be alive yourself, it seems to me.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;But you say I have to take that journey and go down there and slay those dragons. Do I have to go alone?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;If you have someone who can help you, that’s fine, too. But ultimately the last trick has to be done by you.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;In all of these journeys of mythology, there’s a place everyone wishes to find. What is it? The Buddhists talk of nirvana; Jesus talks of peace. There’s a place of rest and repose. Is that typical of the hero’s journey, that there’s a place to find?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;That’s a place in yourself of rest. Now this I know a little bit about from athletics. The athlete who is in championship form has a quiet place in himself. And it’s out of that that his action comes. If he’s all in the action field, he’s not performing properly. There’s a center out of which you act. And Jean, my wife, a dancer, tells me that in dance this is true, too, there’s the center that has to be known and held. There it’s quite physically recognized by the person. But unless this center has been found, you’re torn apart, tension comes. Now, the Buddha’s word is nirvana; nirvana is a psychological slate of mind. It’s not a place, like heaven, it’s not something that’s not here; it is here, in the middle of the turmoil, what’s called samsara, the whirlpool of life conditions. That nirvana is what, is the condition that comes when you are not compelled by desire or by fear, or by social commitments, when you hold your center and act out of there.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;And like all heroes, the Buddha doesn’t show you the truth, the illumination; he shows you the way to it.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;The way. But it’s got to be your way, too. I mean, how should I get rid of fear? The Buddha can’t tell me how I’m going to do it. There are exercises that different teachers will give you, but they may not work for you. And all a teacher can do is give you a clue of the direction. He’s like a lighthouse that says there are rocks over here, and steer clear.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;You talk a lot about consciousness.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Most people hear that term and like me, have only a veiled understanding of it. What is it?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Jean and I are living in Hawaii, and we’re living right by the ocean. And we have a little lanai, a little porch, and there’s a coconut tree that grows up through the porch and it goes on up. And there’s a kind of vine, plant, big powerful thing with leaves like this, that has grown up the coconut tree. Now, that plant sends forth little feelers to go out and clutch the plant, and it knows where the plant is and what to do– where the tree is, and it grows up like this, and it opens a leaf, and that leaf immediately turns to where the sun is. Now, you can’t tell me that leaf doesn’t know where the sun is going to be. All of the leaves go just like that, what’s called heliotropism, turning toward where the sun is. That’s a form of consciousness. There is a plant consciousness, there is an animal consciousness. We share all of these things. You eat certain foods, and the bile knows whether there’s something there for it to go to work on. I mean, the whole thing is consciousness. I begin to feel more and more that the whole world is conscious; certainly the vegetable world is conscious, and when you live in the woods, as I did as a kid, you can see all these different consciousnesses relating to themselves.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Scientists are beginning to talk quite openly about the Gaia principle.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;There you are, the whole planet as an organism.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Mother Earth.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;And you see, if you will think of ourselves as coming out of the earth, rather than as being thrown in here from somewhere else, you know, thrown out of the earth, we are the earth, we are the consciousness of the earth. These are the eyes of the earth, and this is the voice of the earth. What else?</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;How do we raise our consciousness?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, that’s a matter of what you are disposed to think about, and that’s what meditations are for. And all of life is a meditation, most of it unintentional. A lot of people spend most of it in meditating on where their money’s coming from and where it’s going to go, but that’s a level of meditation. Or, if you have a family to bring up, you’re concerned for the family. These are all perfectly, very important concerns, but they have to do with physical conditions, mostly, and spiritual conditions of the children, of course. But how are you going to communicate spiritual consciousness to the children if you don’t have it yourself? So how do you get that? Then you think about the myths. What the myths are for is to bring us into a level of consciousness that is spiritual.</p><p>Just for example, I walk off 52nd Street and Fifth Avenue into Saint Patrick’s Cathedral. I have left a very busy city and one of the most fiercely economically inspired cities on the planet. I walk into that cathedral, and everything around me speaks of spiritual mystery. The mystery of the cross; what’s that all about there? The stained glass windows which bring another atmosphere in. My consciousness has been brought up onto another level altogether, and I am on a different platform. And then I walk out and I’m back in this one again. Now, can I hold something from that? Well, certain prayers or meditations that are associated with the whole context there; these are what are called mantras in India, little meditation themes that hold your consciousness on that level instead of letting it drop down here all the way. And then what you can finally do is to recognize that this is simply a lower level of that.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;The cathedral at Chartres, which you love so much…</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, well.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;It also expresses a relationship of the human to the cosmos, doesn’t it?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I think everyone who has spent any time at Chartres has felt something very special about this cathedral. I’ve been there about eight times. When I was a student in Paris, I went down there about five times and spent one whole weekend, and I identified and looked at every single figure in that cathedral. I was there so much that the concierge, this little old fellow who took care of the cathedral, he came to me one noontime and he said, “Would you like to go up with me and ring the bells?” I said, “I sure would.” So we climbed the fleche, the tower up to where the great bell was, the great enormous bronze bell, and there was a little, like a seesaw. And he stood on one end of the seesaw, and I stood on the other end of the seesaw, and there was a little bar there for us to hold onto. And he gave the thing a push and then he was on it and I was on it, and we started going up and down, and the wind blowing through our hair up there in the cathedral, and then it began underneath. Bong, you know, bong, bong… I tell you, it was one of the most thrilling adventures in my life.</p><p>And when it was all over, he brought me down, he said, “I want to show you where my room is.” Well, in a cathedral you have the nave and then the transept, and then the apse. And around the apse is the choir screen. Now the choir screen in Chartres is about that wide, and he took me in a little door into the middle of the choir screen, and there was his little bed and a little table with a lamp on it, and when I looked out, there was the Black Madonna, the vitrine, the window of the Black Madonna and that was where he lived. Now, there was a man living in a meditation, him? A constant meditation, I mean, that was a very moving, beautiful thing. Oh, I’ve been there time and time again, since.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;What do you find when you go there? What does it say about all that we’ve been discussing?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, first thing it says is, it takes me back to a time when these principles informed the society. I mean, you can tell what’s informed the society by the size of the what the building is that’s the tallest building in the place. When you approach a medieval town, the cathedral’s the tallest thing in the place. When you approach a 17th century city, it’s the political palace that’s the tallest thing in the place. And when you approach a modern city, it’s office buildings and dwellings that are the tallest things in the place.</p><p>And if you go to Salt Lake City, you’ll see the whole thing illustrated right in front of your face. First, the temple was built. The temple was built right in the center of the city. I mean, this was the proper organization, that’s the spiritual center from which all flows in all directions. And then the capitol was built right beside the temple, and it’s bigger than the temple. And now the biggest thing is the office building that takes care of the affairs of both the temple and the political building. That’s the history of Western civilization, from the Gothic through the princely periods of the 16th, 17th, 18th centuries, to this economic world that we’re in now.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;In New York now the debate is over who can build the tallest building, not to praise but to build the tallest building.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, and they are magnificent. I mean, some of the things that are going up in New York now really are, and this is a kind of architectural triumph. And what it is, is the statement of the city; we are a financial power center and look what we can do. It’s a kind of virtuosic acrobatics done.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;Will new myths come from there?</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;Well, something might. You can’t predict what a myth is going to be, any more than you can predict what you’re going to dream tonight. Myths and dreams come from the same place; they come from realizations of some kind that have then to find expression in symbolic form. And the myth, the only myth that’s going to be worth thinking about in the immediate future is one that’s talking about the planet not this city, not these people, but the planet and everybody on it. That’s my main thought for what the future myth is going to be. And what it will have to deal with will be exactly what all myths have dealt with: the maturation of the individual, the gradual the pedagogical way to follow, from dependency through adulthood to maturity, and then to the exit and how to do it. And then how to relate to this society, and how to relate this society to the world of nature and the cosmos. That’s what the myths have all talked about; that’s what this one’s got to talk about. But the society that it’s going to talk about is the society of the planet, and until that gets going, you don’t have anything.</p><p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>&nbsp;There’s that wonderful photograph you have of the Earth seen from space, and it’s very small and at the same time, it’s very grand.</p><p><strong>JOSEPH CAMPBELL:</strong>&nbsp;You don’t see any divisions there of nations or states or anything of the kind. This might be the symbol, really, for the new mythology to come. That is the country that we are going to be celebrating, and those are the people that we are one with.</p><p><br></p>HTML

What hadn't I written about yet?</p><p><br></p><p>I'm in the unusual position of being able to test the essays I write about startups. I hope the ones on other topics are right, but I have no way to test them. The ones on startups get tested by about 70 people every 6 months.</p><p><br></p><p>So I sent all the founders an email asking what surprised them about starting a startup. This amounts to asking what I got wrong, because if I'd explained things well enough, nothing should have surprised them.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm proud to report I got one response saying:</p><blockquote>What surprised me the most is that everything was actually fairly predictable!</blockquote><p>The bad news is that I got over 100 other responses listing the surprises they encountered.</p><p><br></p><p>There were very clear patterns in the responses; it was remarkable how often several people had been surprised by exactly the same thing. These were the biggest:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Be Careful with Cofounders</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This was the surprise mentioned by the most founders. There were two types of responses: that you have to be careful who you pick as a cofounder, and that you have to work hard to maintain your relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>What people wished they'd paid more attention to when choosing cofounders was character and commitment, not ability. This was particularly true with startups that failed. The lesson: don't pick cofounders who will flake.</p><p><br></p><p>Here's a typical reponse:</p><blockquote>You haven't seen someone's true colors unless you've worked with them on a startup.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>The reason character is so important is that it's tested more severely than in most other situations. One founder said explicitly that the relationship between founders was more important than ability:</p><blockquote>I would rather cofound a startup with a friend than a stranger with higher output. Startups are so hard and emotional that the bonds and emotional and social support that come with friendship outweigh the extra output lost.</blockquote><p>We learned this lesson a long time ago. If you look at the YC application, there are more questions about the commitment and relationship of the founders than their ability.</p><p><br></p><p>Founders of successful startups talked less about choosing cofounders and more about how hard they worked to maintain their relationship.</p><blockquote>One thing that surprised me is how the relationship of startup founders goes from a friendship to a marriage. My relationship with my cofounder went from just being friends to seeing each other all the time, fretting over the finances and cleaning up shit. And the startup was our baby. I summed it up once like this: \"It's like we're married, but we're not fucking.\"</blockquote><p>Several people used that word \"married.\" It's a far more intense relationship than you usually see between coworkers—partly because the stresses are so much greater, and partly because at first the founders are the whole company. So this relationship has to be built of top quality materials and carefully maintained. It's the basis of everything.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Startups Take Over Your Life</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Just as the relationship between cofounders is more intense than it usually is between coworkers, so is the relationship between the founders and the company. Running a startup is not like having a job or being a student, because it never stops. This is so foreign to most people's experience that they don't get it till it happens.&nbsp;[<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/really.html#f1n\" target=\"_blank\">1</a>]</p><blockquote>I didn't realize I would spend almost every waking moment either working or thinking about our startup. You enter a whole different way of life when it's your company vs. working for someone else's company.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>It's exacerbated by the fast pace of startups, which makes it seem like time slows down:</p><blockquote>I think the thing that's been most surprising to me is how one's perspective on time shifts. Working on our startup, I remember time seeming to stretch out, so that a month was a huge interval.</blockquote><p>In the best case, total immersion can be exciting:</p><blockquote>It's surprising how much you become consumed by your startup, in that you think about it day and night, but never once does it feel like \"work.\"</blockquote><p>Though I have to say, that quote is from someone we funded this summer. In a couple years he may not sound so chipper.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>

This amounts to asking what I got wrong, because if I'd explained things well enough, nothing should have surprised them.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm proud to report I got one response saying:</p><blockquote>What surprised me the most is that everything was actually fairly predictable!</blockquote><p>The bad news is that I got over 100 other responses listing the surprises they encountered.</p><p><br></p><p>There were very clear patterns in the responses; it was remarkable how often several people had been surprised by exactly the same thing. These were the biggest:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Be Careful with Cofounders</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This was the surprise mentioned by the most founders. There were two types of responses: that you have to be careful who you pick as a cofounder, and that you have to work hard to maintain your relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>What people wished they'd paid more attention to when choosing cofounders was character and commitment, not ability. This was particularly true with startups that failed. The lesson: don't pick cofounders who will flake.</p><p><br></p><p>Here's a typical reponse:</p><blockquote>You haven't seen someone's true colors unless you've worked with them on a startup.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>The reason character is so important is that it's tested more severely than in most other situations. One founder said explicitly that the relationship between founders was more important than ability:</p><blockquote>I would rather cofound a startup with a friend than a stranger with higher output. Startups are so hard and emotional that the bonds and emotional and social support that come with friendship outweigh the extra output lost.</blockquote><p>We learned this lesson a long time ago. If you look at the YC application, there are more questions about the commitment and relationship of the founders than their ability.</p><p><br></p><p>Founders of successful startups talked less about choosing cofounders and more about how hard they worked to maintain their relationship.</p><blockquote>One thing that surprised me is how the relationship of startup founders goes from a friendship to a marriage. My relationship with my cofounder went from just being friends to seeing each other all the time, fretting over the finances and cleaning up shit. And the startup was our baby. I summed it up once like this: \"It's like we're married, but we're not fucking.\"</blockquote><p>Several people used that word \"married.\" It's a far more intense relationship than you usually see between coworkers—partly because the stresses are so much greater, and partly because at first the founders are the whole company. So this relationship has to be built of top quality materials and carefully maintained. It's the basis of everything.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Startups Take Over Your Life</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Just as the relationship between cofounders is more intense than it usually is between coworkers, so is the relationship between the founders and the company. Running a startup is not like having a job or being a student, because it never stops. This is so foreign to most people's experience that they don't get it till it happens.&nbsp;[<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/really.html#f1n\" target=\"_blank\">1</a>]</p><blockquote>I didn't realize I would spend almost every waking moment either working or thinking about our startup. You enter a whole different way of life when it's your company vs. working for someone else's company.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>It's exacerbated by the fast pace of startups, which makes it seem like time slows down:</p><blockquote>I think the thing that's been most surprising to me is how one's perspective on time shifts. Working on our startup, I remember time seeming to stretch out, so that a month was a huge interval.</blockquote><p>In the best case, total immersion can be exciting:</p><blockquote>It's surprising how much you become consumed by your startup, in that you think about it day and night, but never once does it feel like \"work.\"</blockquote><p>Though I have to say, that quote is from someone we funded this summer. In a couple years he may not sound so chipper.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. It's an Emotional Roller-coaster</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This was another one lots of people were surprised about. The ups and downs were more extreme than they were prepared for.</p><p><br></p><p>In a startup, things seem great one moment and hopeless the next. And by next, I mean a couple hours later.</p><blockquote>The emotional ups and downs were the biggest surprise for me. One day, we'd think of ourselves as the next Google and dream of buying islands; the next, we'd be pondering how to let our loved ones know of our utter failure; and on and on.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>The hard part, obviously, is the lows. For a lot of founders that was the big surprise:</p><blockquote>How hard it is to keep everyone motivated during rough days or weeks, i.e. how low the lows can be.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>After a while, if you don't have significant success to cheer you up, it wears you out:</p><blockquote>Your most basic advice to founders is \"just don't die,\" but the energy to keep a company going in lieu of unburdening success isn't free; it is siphoned from the founders themselves.</blockquote><p>There's a limit to how much you can take. If you get to the point where you can't keep working anymore, it's not the end of the world. Plenty of famous founders have had some failures along the way.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. It Can Be Fun</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The good news is, the highs are also very high. Several founders said what surprised them most about doing a startup was how fun it was:</p><blockquote>I think you've left out just how fun it is to do a startup. I am more fulfilled in my work than pretty much any of my friends who did not start companies.</blockquote><p>What they like most is the freedom:</p><blockquote>I'm surprised by how much better it feels to be working on something that is challenging and creative, something I believe in, as opposed to the hired-gun stuff I was doing before. I knew it would feel better; what's surprising is how much better.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Frankly, though, if I've misled people here, I'm not eager to fix that. I'd rather have everyone think starting a startup is grim and hard than have founders go into it expecting it to be fun, and a few months later saying \"This is supposed to be&nbsp;<em>fun</em>? Are you kidding?\"</p><p><br></p><p>The truth is, it wouldn't be fun for most people. A lot of what we try to do in the application process is to weed out the people who wouldn't like it, both for our sake and theirs.</p><p><br></p><p>The best way to put it might be that starting a startup is fun the way a survivalist training course would be fun, if you're into that sort of thing. Which is to say, not at all, if you're not.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Persistence Is the Key</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A lot of founders were surprised how important persistence was in startups. It was both a negative and a positive surprise: they were surprised both by the degree of persistence required</p><blockquote>Everyone said how determined and resilient you must be, but going through it made me realize that the determination required was still understated.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>and also by the degree to which persistence alone was able to dissolve obstacles:</p><blockquote>If you are persistent, even problems that seem out of your control (i.e. immigration) seem to work themselves out.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Several founders mentioned specifically how much more important persistence was than intelligence.</p><blockquote>I've been surprised again and again by just how much more important persistence is than raw intelligence.</blockquote><p>This applies not just to intelligence but to ability in general, and that's why so many people said character was more important in choosing cofounders.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>6. Think Long-Term</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You need persistence because everything takes longer than you expect. A lot of people were surprised by that.</p><blockquote>I'm continually surprised by how long everything can take. Assuming your product doesn't experience the explosive growth that very few products do, everything from development to dealmaking (especially dealmaking) seems to take 2-3x longer than I always imagine.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>One reason founders are surprised is that because they work fast, they expect everyone else to. There's a shocking amount of shear stress at every point where a startup touches a more bureaucratic organization, like a big company or a VC fund. That's why fundraising and the enterprise market kill and maim so many startups.&nbsp;[<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/really.html#f2n\" target=\"_blank\">2</a>]</p><p><br></p><p>But I think the reason most founders are surprised by how long it takes is that they're overconfident. They think they're going to be an instant success, like YouTube or Facebook. You tell them only 1 out of 100 successful startups has a trajectory like that, and they all think \"we're going to be that 1.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe they'll listen to one of the more successful founders:</p><blockquote>The top thing I didn't understand before going into it is that persistence is the name of the game. For the vast majority of startups that become successful, it's going to be a&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;long journey, at least 3 years and probably 5+.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>There is a positive side to thinking longer-term. It's not just that you have to resign yourself to everything taking longer than it should. If you work patiently it's less stressful, and you can do better work:</p><blockquote>Because we're relaxed, it's so much easier to have fun doing what we do. Gone is the awkward nervous energy fueled by the desperate need to not fail guiding our actions. We can concentrate on doing what's best for our company, product, employees and customers.</blockquote><p>That's why things get so much better when you hit ramen profitability. You can shift into a different mode of working.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>7. Lots of Little Things</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We often emphasize how rarely startups win simply because they hit on some magic idea. I think founders have now gotten that into their heads. But a lot were surprised to find this also applies within startups. You have to do lots of different things:</p><blockquote>It's much more of a grind than glamorous. A timeslice selected at random would more likely find me tracking down a weird DLL loading bug on Swedish Windows, or tracking down a bug in the financial model Excel spreadsheet the night before a board meeting, rather than having brilliant flashes of strategic insight.</blockquote><p>Most hacker-founders would like to spend all their time programming. You won't get to, unless you fail. Which can be transformed into: If you spend all your time programming, you will fail.</p><p><br></p><p>The principle extends even into programming. There is rarely a single brilliant hack that ensures success:</p><blockquote>I learnt never to bet on any one feature or deal or anything to bring you success. It is never a single thing. Everything is just incremental and you just have to keep doing lots of those things until you strike something.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Even in the rare cases where a clever hack makes your fortune, you probably won't know till later:</p><blockquote>There is no such thing as a killer feature. Or at least you won't know what it is.</blockquote><p>So the best strategy is to try lots of different things. The reason not to put all your eggs in one basket is not the usual one, which applies even when you know which basket is best. In a startup you don't even know that.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>8. Start with Something Minimal</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Lots of founders mentioned how important it was to launch with the simplest possible thing. By this point everyone knows you should release fast and iterate. It's practically a mantra at YC. But even so a lot of people seem to have been burned by not doing it:</p><blockquote>Build the absolute smallest thing that can be considered a complete application and ship it.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Why do people take too long on the first version? Pride, mostly. They hate to release something that could be better. They worry what people will say about them. But you have to overcome this:</p><blockquote>Doing something \"simple\" at first glance does not mean you aren't doing something meaningful, defensible, or valuable.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Don't worry what people will say. If your first version is so impressive that trolls don't make fun of it, you waited too long to launch.&nbsp;[<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/really.html#f3n\" target=\"_blank\">3</a>]</p><p><br></p><p>One founder said this should be your approach to all programming, not just startups, and I tend to agree.</p><blockquote>Now, when coding, I try to think \"How can I write this such that if people saw my code, they'd be amazed at how little there is and how little it does?\"</blockquote><p>Over-engineering is poison. It's not like doing extra work for extra credit. It's more like telling a lie that you then have to remember so you don't contradict it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>9. Engage Users</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Product development is a conversation with the user that doesn't really start till you launch. Before you launch, you're like a police artist before he's shown the first version of his sketch to the witness.</p><p><br></p><p>It's so important to launch fast that it may be better to think of your initial version not as a product, but as a trick for getting users to start talking to you.</p><blockquote>I learned to think about the initial stages of a startup as a giant experiment. All products should be considered experiments, and those that have a market show promising results extremely quickly.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Once you start talking to users, I guarantee you'll be surprised by what they tell you.</p><blockquote>When you let customers tell you what they're after, they will often reveal amazing details about what they find valuable as well what they're willing to pay for.</blockquote><p>The surprise is generally positive as well as negative. They won't like what you've built, but there will be other things they would like that would be trivially easy to implement. It's not till you start the conversation by launching the wrong thing that they can express (or perhaps even realize) what they're looking for.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>10. Change Your Idea</strong></p><p><br></p><p>To benefit from engaging with users you have to be willing to change your idea. We've always encouraged founders to see a startup idea as a hypothesis rather than a blueprint. And yet they're still surprised how well it works to change the idea.</p><blockquote>Normally if you complain about something being hard, the general advice is to work harder. With a startup, I think you should find a problem that's easy for you to solve. Optimizing in solution-space is familiar and straightforward, but you can make enormous gains playing around in problem-space.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Whereas mere determination, without flexibility, is a greedy algorithm that may get you nothing more than a mediocre local maximum:</p><blockquote>When someone is determined, there's still a danger that they'll follow a long, hard path that ultimately leads nowhere.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>You want to push forward, but at the same time twist and turn to find the most promising path. One founder put it very succinctly:</p><blockquote>Fast iteration is the key to success.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>One reason this advice is so hard to follow is that people don't realize how hard it is to judge startup ideas, particularly their own. Experienced founders learn to keep an open mind:</p><blockquote>Now I don't laugh at ideas anymore, because I realized how terrible I was at knowing if they were good or not.</blockquote><p>You can never tell what will work. You just have to do whatever seems best at each point. We do this with YC itself. We still don't know if it will work, but it seems like a decent hypothesis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>11. Don't Worry about Competitors</strong></p><p><br></p><p>When you think you've got a great idea, it's sort of like having a guilty conscience about something. All someone has to do is look at you funny, and you think \"Oh my God,&nbsp;<em>they know.</em>\"</p><p><br></p><p>These alarms are almost always false:</p><blockquote>Companies that seemed like competitors and threats at first glance usually never were when you really looked at it. Even if they were operating in the same area, they had a different goal.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>One reason people overreact to competitors is that they overvalue ideas. If ideas really were the key, a competitor with the same idea would be a real threat. But it's usually execution that matters:</p><blockquote>All the scares induced by seeing a new competitor pop up are forgotten weeks later. It always comes down to your own product and approach to the market.</blockquote><p>This is generally true even if competitors get lots of attention.</p><blockquote>Competitors riding on lots of good blogger perception aren't really the winners and can disappear from the map quickly. You need consumers after all.</blockquote><p>Hype doesn't make satisfied users, at least not for something as complicated as technology.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>12. It's Hard to Get Users</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A lot of founders complained about how hard it was to get users, though.</p><blockquote>I had no idea how much time and effort needed to go into attaining users.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>This is a complicated topic. When you can't get users, it's hard to say whether the problem is lack of exposure, or whether the product's simply bad. Even good products can be blocked by switching or integration costs:</p><blockquote>Getting people to use a new service is incredibly difficult. This is especially true for a service that other companies can use, because it requires their developers to do work. If you're small, they don't think it is urgent.&nbsp;[<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/really.html#f4n\" target=\"_blank\">4</a>]</blockquote><p><br></p><p>The sharpest criticism of YC came from a founder who said we didn't focus enough on customer acquisition:</p><blockquote>YC preaches \"make something people want\" as an engineering task, a never ending stream of feature after feature until enough people are happy and the application takes off. There's very little focus on the cost of customer acquisition.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>This may be true; this may be something we need to fix, especially for applications like games. If you make something where the challenges are mostly technical, you can rely on word of mouth, like Google did. One founder was surprised by how well that worked for him:</p><blockquote>There is an irrational fear that no one will buy your product. But if you work hard and incrementally make it better, there is no need to worry.</blockquote><p>But with other types of startups you may win less by features and more by deals and marketing.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>13. Expect the Worst with Deals</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Deals fall through. That's a constant of the startup world. Startups are powerless, and good startup ideas generally seem wrong. So everyone is nervous about closing deals with you, and you have no way to make them.</p><p><br></p><p>This is particularly true with investors:</p><blockquote>In retrospect, it would have been much better if we had operated under the assumption that we would never get any additional outside investment. That would have focused us on finding revenue streams early.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>My advice is generally pessimistic. Assume you won't get money, and if someone does offer you any, assume you'll never get any more.</p><blockquote>If someone offers you money, take it. You say it a lot, but I think it needs even more emphasizing. We had the opportunity to raise a lot more money than we did last year and I wish we had.</blockquote><p>Why do founders ignore me? Mostly because they're optimistic by nature. The mistake is to be optimistic about things you can't control. By all means be optimistic about your ability to make something great. But you're asking for trouble if you're optimistic about big companies or investors.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>14. Investors Are Clueless</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A lot of founders mentioned how surprised they were by the cluelessness of investors:</p><blockquote>They don't even know about the stuff they've invested in. I met some investors that had invested in a hardware device and when I asked them to demo the device they had difficulty switching it on.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Angels are a bit better than VCs, because they usually have startup experience themselves:</p><blockquote>VC investors don't know half the time what they are talking about and are years behind in their thinking. A few were great, but 95% of the investors we dealt with were unprofessional, didn't seem to be very good at business or have any kind of creative vision. Angels were generally much better to talk to.</blockquote><p>Why are founders surprised that VCs are clueless? I think it's because they seem so formidable.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason VCs seem formidable is that it's their profession to. You get to be a VC by convincing asset managers to trust you with hundreds of millions of dollars. How do you do that? You have to seem confident, and you have to seem like you understand technology.&nbsp;[<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/really.html#f5n\" target=\"_blank\">5</a>]</p><p><br></p><p><strong>15. You May Have to Play Games</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Because investors are so bad at judging you, you have to work harder than you should at selling yourself. One founder said the thing that surprised him most was</p><blockquote>The degree to which feigning certitude impressed investors.</blockquote><p>This is the thing that has surprised&nbsp;<em>me</em>&nbsp;most about YC founders' experiences. This summer we invited some of the alumni to talk to the new startups about fundraising, and pretty much 100% of their advice was about investor psychology. I thought I was cynical about VCs, but the founders were much more cynical.</p><blockquote>A lot of what startup founders do is just posturing. It works.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>VCs themselves have no idea of the extent to which the startups they like are the ones that are best at selling themselves to VCs.[<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/really.html#f6n\" target=\"_blank\">6</a>]&nbsp;It's exactly the same phenomenon we saw a step earlier. VCs get money by seeming confident to LPs, and founders get money by seeming confident to VCs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>16. Luck Is a Big Factor</strong></p><p><br></p><p>With two such random linkages in the path between startups and money, it shouldn't be surprising that luck is a big factor in deals. And yet a lot of founders are surprised by it.</p><blockquote>I didn't realize how much of a role luck plays and how much is outside of our control.</blockquote><p>If you think about famous startups, it's pretty clear how big a role luck plays. Where would Microsoft be if IBM insisted on an exclusive license for DOS?</p><p><br></p><p>Why are founders fooled by this? Business guys probably aren't, but hackers are used to a world where skill is paramount, and you get what you deserve.</p><blockquote>When we started our startup, I had bought the hype of the startup founder dream: that this is a game of skill. It is, in some ways. Having skill is valuable. So is being determined as all hell. But being lucky is the critical ingredient.</blockquote><p>Actually the best model would be to say that the outcome is the<em>product</em>&nbsp;of skill, determination, and luck. No matter how much skill and determination you have, if you roll a zero for luck, the outcome is zero.</p><p><br></p><p>These quotes about luck are not from founders whose startups failed. Founders who fail quickly tend to blame themselves. Founders who succeed quickly don't usually realize how lucky they were. It's the ones in the middle who see how important luck is.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>17. The Value of Community</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A surprising number of founders said what surprised them most about starting a startup was the value of community. Some meant the micro-community of YC founders:</p><blockquote>The immense value of the peer group of YC companies, and facing similar obstacles at similar times.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>which shouldn't be that surprising, because that's why it's structured that way. Others were surprised at the value of the startup community in the larger sense:</p><blockquote>How advantageous it is to live in Silicon Valley, where you can't help but hear all the cutting-edge tech and startup news, and run into useful people constantly.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>The specific thing that surprised them most was the general spirit of benevolence:</p><blockquote>One of the most surprising things I saw was the willingness of people to help us. Even people who had nothing to gain went out of their way to help our startup succeed.</blockquote><p>and particularly how it extended all the way to the top:</p><blockquote>The surprise for me was how accessible important and interesting people are. It's amazing how easily you can reach out to people and get immediate feedback.</blockquote><p>This is one of the reasons I like being part of this world. Creating wealth is not a zero-sum game, so you don't have to stab people in the back to win.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>18. You Get No Respect</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There was one surprise founders mentioned that I'd forgotten about: that outside the startup world, startup founders get no respect.</p><blockquote>In social settings, I found that I got a lot more respect when I said, \"I worked on Microsoft Office\" instead of \"I work at a small startup you've never heard of called x.\"</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Partly this is because the rest of the world just doesn't get startups, and partly it's yet another consequence of the fact that most good startup ideas seem bad:</p><blockquote>If you pitch your idea to a random person, 95% of the time you'll find the person instinctively thinks the idea will be a flop and you're wasting your time (although they probably won't say this directly).</blockquote><p>Unfortunately this extends even to dating:</p><blockquote>It surprised me that being a startup founder does not get you more admiration from women.</blockquote><p>I did know about that, but I'd forgotten.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>19. Things Change as You Grow</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The last big surprise founders mentioned is how much things changed as they grew. The biggest change was that you got to program even less:</p><blockquote>Your job description as technical founder/CEO is completely rewritten every 6-12 months. Less coding, more managing/planning/company building, hiring, cleaning up messes, and generally getting things in place for what needs to happen a few months from now.</blockquote><p>In particular, you now have to deal with employees, who often have different motivations:</p><blockquote>I knew the founder equation and had been focused on it since I knew I wanted to start a startup as a 19 year old. The employee equation is quite different so it took me a while to get it down.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Fortunately, it can become a lot less stressful once you reach cruising altitude:</p><blockquote>I'd say 75% of the stress is gone now from when we first started. Running a business is so much more enjoyable now. We're more confident. We're more patient. We fight less. We sleep more.</blockquote><p>I wish I could say it was this way for every startup that succeeded, but 75% is probably on the high side.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Super-Pattern</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There were a few other patterns, but these were the biggest. One's first thought when looking at them all is to ask if there's a super-pattern, a pattern to the patterns.</p><p><br></p><p>I saw it immediately, and so did a YC founder I read the list to. These are supposed to be the surprises, the things I didn't tell people. What do they all have in common? They're all things I tell people. If I wrote a new essay with the same outline as this that wasn't summarizing the founders' responses, everyone would say I'd run out of ideas and was just repeating myself.</p><p><br></p><p>What is going on here?</p><p><br></p><p>When I look at the responses, the common theme is that starting a startup was like I said, but way more so. People just don't seem to get how different it is till they do it. Why? The key to that mystery is to ask, how different&nbsp;<em>from what?</em>&nbsp;Once you phrase it that way, the answer is obvious: from a job. Everyone's model of work is a job. It's completely pervasive. Even if you've never had a job, your parents probably did, along with practically every other adult you've met.</p><p><br></p><p>Unconsciously, everyone expects a startup to be like a job, and that explains most of the surprises. It explains why people are surprised how carefully you have to choose cofounders and how hard you have to work to maintain your relationship. You don't have to do that with coworkers. It explains why the ups and downs are surprisingly extreme. In a job there is much more damping. But it also explains why the good times are surprisingly good: most people can't imagine such freedom. As you go down the list, almost all the surprises are surprising in how much a startup differs from a job.</p><p><br></p><p>You probably can't overcome anything so pervasive as the model of work you grew up with. So the best solution is to be consciously aware of that. As you go into a startup, you'll be thinking \"everyone says it's really extreme.\" Your next thought will probably be \"but I can't believe it will be that bad.\" If you want to avoid being surprised, the next thought after that should be: \"and the reason I can't believe it will be that bad is that my model of work is a job.\"</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><br></p><p>[1] Graduate students might understand it. In grad school you always feel you should be working on your thesis. It doesn't end every semester like classes do.</p><p><br></p><p>[2] The best way for a startup to engage with slow-moving organizations is to fork off separate processes to deal with them. It's when they're on the critical path that they kill you—when you depend on closing a deal to move forward. It's worth taking extreme measures to avoid that.</p><p><br></p><p>[3] This is a variant of Reid Hoffman's principle that if you aren't embarrassed by what you launch with, you waited too long to launch.</p><p><br></p><p>[4] The question to ask about what you've built is not whether it's good, but whether it's good enough to supply the activation energy required.</p><p><br></p><p>[5] Some VCs seem to understand technology because they actually do, but that's overkill; the defining test is whether you can talk about it well enough to convince limited partners.</p><p><br></p><p>[6] This is the same phenomenon you see with defense contractors or fashion brands. The dumber the customers, the more effort you expend on the process of selling things to them rather than making the things you sell.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Thanks:</strong>&nbsp;to Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this, and to all the founders who responded to my email.</p>HTML

<p><em>Excerpt from http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page38.htm</em></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">It was about this time I conceived the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection. I wished to live without committing any fault at any time; I would conquer all that either natural inclination, custom, or company might lead me into. As I knew, or thought I knew, what was right and wrong, I did not see why I might not always do the one and avoid the other. But I soon found I had undertaken a task of more difficulty than I had imagined. While my care was employed in guarding against one fault, I was often surprised by another; habit took the advantage of inattention; inclination was sometimes too strong for reason. I concluded, at length, that the mere speculative conviction that it was our interest to be completely virtuous was not sufficient to prevent our slipping, and that the contrary habits must be broken, and good ones acquired and established, before we can have any dependence on a steady, uniform rectitude of conduct. For this purpose I therefore contrived the following method.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">In the various enumerations of the moral virtues I met in my reading, I found the catalogue more or less numerous, as different writers included more or fewer ideas under the same name. Temperance, for example, was by some confined to eating and drinking, while by others it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure, appetite, inclination, or passion, bodily or mental, even to our avarice and ambition. I proposed to myself, for the sake of clearness, to use rather more names, with fewer ideas annexed to each, than a few names with more ideas; and I included under thirteen names of virtues all that at that time occurred to me as necessary or desirable, and annexed to each a short precept, which fully expressed the extent I gave to its meaning.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">These names of virtues, with their precepts were:</span></p><p><br></p><ol><li>Temperance</li><li>Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.</li><li><br></li><li>Silence</li><li>Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.</li><li><br></li><li>Order</li><li>Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.</li><li><br></li><li>Resolution</li><li>Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.</li><li><br></li><li>Frugality</li><li>Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself, i.e., waste nothing.</li><li><br></li><li>Industry</li><li>Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.</li><li><br></li><li>Sincerity.</li><li>Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.</li><li><br></li><li>Justice</li><li>Wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefits that are your duty.</li><li><br></li><li>Moderation</li><li>Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.</li><li><br></li><li>Cleanliness</li><li>Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation.</li><li><br></li><li>Tranquillity</li><li>Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.</li><li><br></li><li>Chastity</li><li>Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.</li><li><br></li><li>Humility</li><li>Imitate Jesus and Socrates.</li><li><br></li></ol><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">My intention being to acquire the&nbsp;</span><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">habitude</em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;of all these virtues, I judged it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time, and, when I should be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on, till I should have gone thro' the thirteen; and, as the previous acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others, I arranged them with that view, as they stand above. Temperance first, as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head which is so necessary where constant vigilance was to be kept up, and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits and the force of perpetual temptations. This being acquired and established, Silence would be more easy; and my desire being to gain knowledge at the same time that I improved in virtue, and considering that in conversation it was obtained rather by the use of the ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I was getting into prattling, punning, and joking, which only made me acceptable to trifling company, I gave&nbsp;</span><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Silence</em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;the second place. This and the next,&nbsp;</span><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Order</em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">, I expected would allow me more time for attending to my project and my studies. Resolution, once because habitual, would keep me firm in my endeavors to obtain all the subsequent virtues;&nbsp;</span><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Frugality</em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">and Industry, freeing me from my remaining debt, and producing affluence and independence, would make more easy the practice of Sincerity and Justice, etc., Conceiving, then, that, agreeably to the advice of Pythagoras in his Garden Verses, daily examination would be necessary, I contrived the following method for conducting that examination.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues. I ruled each page with red ink, so as to have seven columns, one for each day of the week, marking each column with a letter for the day. I crossed these columns with thirteen red lines, marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by a little black spot, every fault I found upon examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day</span></h3>

This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p><p><br></p><p>But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free; one hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination; one hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity; one hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land.</p><p><br></p><p>So we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was the promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note in so far as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.”&nbsp;But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we have come to cash this check,&nbsp;a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom&nbsp;and the security of justice.</p><p><br></p><p>We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy; now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice; now is the time&nbsp;to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood; now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children. It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content, will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.&nbsp;There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the worn threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protests to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy, which has engulfed the Negro community, must not lead us to a distrust of all white people. For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny&nbsp;is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.</p><p><br></p><p>There are those who are asking the devotees of Civil Rights, “When will you be satisfied?” We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality; we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities; we cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one; we can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating “For Whites Only”;&nbsp;we cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro in Mississippi cannot vote, and the Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No! no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until “justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.”</p><p><br></p>

Photography for me is about capturing meaningful stories, and nothing more. It is completely normal to expect readers commenting on the inclusion or exclusion of certain images.</p><p>The purpose is not to exclude or include, but to mention world famous photos that had been renowned as iconic due to their social and anthropological importance. Please feel free to share other images that could be considered as historically important in order to get a richer experience through the social development of these words. Without further ado, let’s talk about some world famous photos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Sharbat Gula – Steve McCurry – 1984</strong></h2><p>Published for the first time in 1985, the iconic portrait of a young afghan girl, refuged from the war, still evoques to this day, a deep and complex mix of feelings and emotions.

A photographer is aware of the tiny moments in a person’s life that reveal greater truths.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Anonymous</em></strong></blockquote><p>Choosing a batch of world famous photos&nbsp;is really complex, but really fun to do, because studying images, is for me the best way to learn about photography in its essence. Photography for me is about capturing meaningful stories, and nothing more. It is completely normal to expect readers commenting on the inclusion or exclusion of certain images.</p><p>The purpose is not to exclude or include, but to mention world famous photos that had been renowned as iconic due to their social and anthropological importance. Please feel free to share other images that could be considered as historically important in order to get a richer experience through the social development of these words. Without further ado, let’s talk about some world famous photos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Sharbat Gula – Steve McCurry – 1984</strong></h2><p>Published for the first time in 1985, the iconic portrait of a young afghan girl, refuged from the war, still evoques to this day, a deep and complex mix of feelings and emotions. After seventeen years, Steve McCurry found her, and portrayed her again.</p><p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-26hWS8K/0/O/i-26hWS8K.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"550\">© Steve McCurry</p><p>This image is the superb portrait, of all portraits, of all time for me.

Published for the first time in the 23th issue of the French magazine Vu, the photograph was printed and reprinted over and over again, and became the war’s icon, and one of the most famous war photograph ever been taken. Two years after that picture, the British magazine Picture Post stated that this 25 year old photographer, was the best war photographer of the world.</p><p>The image is really controversial because it has been surrounded with many theories that debate on it’s authenticity. It has been said that the image in fact was staged. Nevertheless, the image shows a clear reality about the harsh vulnerabilities that people endure during war.</p><p>The image shows the rifle of the soldier falling while the body of the soldier falls to the ground. The image shows the fragility and the immediacy in which death could happen to a human being. The surrounding field and mountains have served studious people as the key studium to determine the veracity of the image.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Migrant Mother – Dorothea Lange – 1936</strong></h2><p>Migrant Mother from Nipomo, a picture taken by Dorothea Lange in her home state California, is the emblematic icon of the harsh realities Americans endured during the Great Depression of the 1930s. This is most well-known image taken by during the project commissioned by the Farm Security Administration in the pursuit of capturing the impact of the Great Depression on the American Families. Dorothea Lange stated that she found this woman while working on the journalistic project, she was a mother of seven children at that time and that she spent as little as ten minutes picturing them. The image is a pure capture of a real moment in time.</p><p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-jWkQw79/0/X2/i-jWkQw79-X2.jpg\" alt=\"World Famous Photos - Migrant Mother - Dorothea Lange – 1936\" height=\"930\" width=\"746\">© Dorothea Lange</p><p>This image is the archetype that represents the victims of such economical struggle, and portrait centers at first, in just one person. Dorothea Lange didn’t mentioned the name of the woman, and decades later it was recognized that the woman in fact was Florence Owens Thompson, which lived at that time in the Cherokee territories of Oklahoma. The fact that the name wasn’t stated by the photographer, makes a complex deal around the job of a photojournalist in a documentary work, but I personally think that she knew about the importance of the image as an archetype, and the name wasn’t necessary. But, the same Florence Owens Thompson recognized years later that she wasn’t comfortable that her image worked as the eternal depiction of poverty. The image is also part of the assets of MoMA.</p><p>If we study the image, we can easily recognize her as the center of the image. Lange had a fixation on hands as symbols of the hard work many people had to perpetrate for a living, and this one is no exception, but here the hands show us a little more, they show us a great amount of worrying. And last but not least, the three children on the image. There are two kids, framing Florence side by side, and suddenly, we can see a baby that looks vulnerable to the harsh realities surrounding them. We can say that the punctum of the image is the worry in her eyes and hands, and the studium of the image, is the difficult context of raising a vast family under the struggles of the depression.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Hyeres – Henri Cartier-Bresson – 1932</strong></h2><p>Cartier-Bresson was known for his challenging approach of not cropping his images, and showcased them right as they were framed in camera. He talked a lot about the Decisive Moment, which is few words, the ability of capturing a moment, right before it happens. I don’t remember the source, but I heard once that he said (and this one was printed in my memory) that if you had seen the moment, it had just occurred, and that one as a photographer must be able to see the moment before it happens.</p><p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-V52jF8z/0/L/i-V52jF8z-L.jpg\" alt=\"World Famous Photos - Hyeres - Henri Cartier-Bresson – 1932\" height=\"536\" width=\"800\">© Henri Cartier-Bresson</p><p>The image called Hyeres by Cartier-Bresson is almost all the illustration needed in order to comprehend composition. We have rule of thirds everywhere, but mainly on the bicycle rider, and we have leading lines everywhere, from the sidewalk, to the obvious swirl on the hand railing of the stairs. And if that wasn’t enough, the slow shutter speed, shows a great sense of movement and dynamism of the rider exiting the scene.</p><p>The picture itself was taken in Hyeres in 1932, and has been present as an iconic image of Henri Cartier-Bresson during several retrospectives. The decisive moment here is obvious, and it beautifully juxtaposes the freedom of the rider, with the rigid soul of the balcony and the railings. The image seems even to be taken by accident, but thanks to his theory of the decisive moment, chances of doing things the way he intended, were and are, on his side. We can also think that this was the product of a long wait, which is in fact valid. Photography is about patience, and we must never forget it.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Steve Jobs – Albert Watson – 2011</strong></h2><p>Iconic, simple, intriguing, just like his legacy. Soon after passing away, Steve Jobs portrait became the landing image of apple.com, and I think that is one of the most important portraits of our current times. The images was taken by Albert Watson in a 4×5 camera, ironic twist for such an innovative person like Jobs was.</p><p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-DS3BsnP/0/O/i-DS3BsnP.jpg\" alt=\"World Famous Photos - Steve Jobs - Albert Watson – 2011\" height=\"556\" width=\"800\">© Albert Watson</p><p>It doesn’t really matter what sort of technicalities Watson defined for this portrait, the image is about one person, and nothing more. The pose of his hand suggest constant thinking, and the subtle smile drawn in his face, transmits a great energy and confidence. The look pierces into the viewer and the black and white choice, was the perfect way to go in order to avoid any distractions.</p><p>Few people have not seen this picture of Steve Jobs; and the way it was spread around the globe, made it an iconic portrait of our times in no time.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Lunchtime atop a Skyscraper – Charles C. Ebbets – 1932</strong></h2><p>This image shows the tranquility of eleven of the several workers that worked during the construction of the 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan. They are not just relaxed over the crossbeam, but they are also having lunch, which gives the image a curious character.</p><p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-fNgTBZ4/0/L/i-fNgTBZ4-L.jpg\" alt=\"World Famous Photos - Lunchtime atop a Skyscraper - Charles C. Ebbets – 1932\" height=\"600\" width=\"765\">© Charles C. Ebbets</p><p>The image is very iconic, and was taken by Charles C. Ebbets in 1932 and there has been a lot said whether the scene really happened or if it was just a publicity maneuver for some sort of reason, but it doesn’t diminish the fact that the men were real ironworkers at the 69th floor of the building on the last stages of its construction, and there have been numerous claims regarding the identities of the men in the image.</p><p>The image has been a great icon of the hard working culture of the human being, and also a great example of how much have evolved in terms of Occupational health and Safety as well. This is something that just won’t be seen again, I hope.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>V-J day in Times Square – Alfred Eisenstaedt – 1945</strong></h2><p>It is fair that the image related to the end of the World War II, came out of the hands and eyes of a Jewish photographer. Here we can appreciate the great moment two of the greatest symbols of the war meet in a deep and passionate kiss.</p><p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-tqfCjVf/0/X2/i-tqfCjVf-X2.jpg\" alt=\"World Famous Photos - V-J day in Times Square - Alfred Eisenstaedt – 1945\" height=\"960\" width=\"639\">© Alfred Eisenstaedt</p><p>The two symbols are humans indeed, but they are the anonymous ambassadors of both all the sailors and all the nurses that worked hard during the war. The both institutions were fundamental pillars that helped United States to maintain its strength during the horrors of war. The celebration is due the end of such a violent and bloody period of our modern history, the image was taken in Times Square, New York City.</p><p>There is another image from a slightly different angle (almost like what happened with the two pictures of Iesha Evans during the Baton Rouge protests in July this year) but the iconic one, due to its point of view and composition (I guess) is the one that Alfred Eisenstaedt took, but still the less popular image of Victor Jorgensen, is great, because it still captures the essence of this great summit of the War.</p><p>The image doesn’t give a clear distinction between the two faces in the frame, which hoists the character of the symbols.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Einstein’s Birthday – Arthur Sasse – 1951</strong></h2><p>Often called “Einstein’s Tongue”, is an image that became iconic due to its humorous character. Humor as itself requires intelligence, and capturing humor in photography (especially when done candidly) is one of the hardest things to do in the discipline. The picture shows a different profile of Albert Einstein, and it’s playful and nutty character is what makes the image so great.</p><p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-vHRLC8v/0/XL/i-vHRLC8v-XL.jpg\" alt=\"World Famous Photos - Einstein’s Birthday - Arthur Sasse – 1951\" height=\"768\" width=\"604\">© Arthur Sasse</p><p>The moment occurred in the 72th Albert Einstein’s birthday celebration, and a lot of photographers were there, but just Sasse capture the one that became iconic. We can delight ourselves with a humorous Einstein, instead of the Nobel prize-winning physicist who developed the theory of general relativity, therefore, we have a more accessible side of Albert Einstein.</p><p>A really important background fact of the image, is that Einstein enjoyed it so much that asked the UPI (United Press International) to facilitate him nine copies of the cropped image for his personal use. One of those personal uses landed on Howard K. Smith, a friend of Einstein. The image, as predictable, had a little text at the back, the text quoted this “This gesture you will like, because it is aimed at all of humanity. A civilian can afford to do what no diplomat would dare.”</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Guerrillero Heroico – Alberto Korda – 1960</strong></h2><p>Just like V – J Day felt correctly shot by a Jew, this one feels appropriate to be shot by a Cuban. Ernesto “Che” Guevara was Argentinian, but the close friendship he had with Fidel Castro, makes a correct correspondence that the image was in fact taken by a Cuban. Alberto Diaz Gutierrez, best known as Alberto Korda, was the official photographer of Fidel Castro for 9 years, and traveled with him to many countries as well.</p><p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-pnPbH6C/0/L/i-pnPbH6C-L.jpg\" alt=\"World Famous Photos - Guerrillero Heroico - Alberto Korda - 1960\" height=\"532\" width=\"800\">© Alberto Korda</p><p>Ernesto “Che” Guevara was photographed in very remarkable ways, like the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.ricecracker.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Picture-18.png\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(170, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">one</a>&nbsp;that Rene Burri did of him. But the one that immortalize the heroic character of the Che, is Korda’s without a doubt. It had been widely spread from flags, to t-shirts to stickers, and the story behind the image, is the following. March the 4th of 1960, the French freight ship La Coubre, was transporting weapons from Belgium to Cuba to equip Castro’s regime. The boat exploded, and Castro blamed it on the United States. More than 75 persons died in the happening. The next day, a solemn funeral was celebrated in La Habana. While the speakers of the ceremony where dictating some words, Alberto Korda took two images of Guevara. He didn’t noticed the picture taking, and with time, the image became not just iconic, but symbolic.</p><p>Alberto Korda was never happy with the fact that the image was used commercially in the way it did, since it was a completely contradiction to the Che’s believes, the ones he died for.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>General Nguyen Ngoc Loan Executing a Viet Cong Prisoner – Eddie Adams – 1968</strong></h2><p>It is been said that no other group of photojournalist had the freedom of portraying the atrocities of war, than those that walked around the bloody boundaries of the Vietnam War. Here we are in front of one of the cruelest images ever captured by a photographer. The image itself accredited Eddie Adams the Pulitzer Prize in 1969.</p><p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-DTGWfTR/0/L/i-DTGWfTR-L.jpg\" alt=\"World Famous Photos - General Nguyen Ngoc Loan Executing a Viet Cong Prisoner - Eddie Adams – 1968\" height=\"566\" width=\"800\">© Eddie Adams</p><p>Eddie Adams explains what happened in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf5pJXr3gWQ\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(170, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">this</a>&nbsp;short video, and honestly it feels like a true and honest reaction of a committed photographer, he saw the officer raising his gun, he instinctively raised his camera. The image became iconic almost immediately, and serves as a raw evidence of the horrors of war.</p><p>This image is without any doubt, the most iconic image of the Vietnam War, due to its proximity to the exact brief moment one man takes the life of another man. The uniformed South Vietnamese officer shoots a prisoner in the head, and the brutality of the moment, got immortalized thanks to photography. This is why Photojournalism is so important, so we can remember things that may not be repeated.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>The Mahatma – By Margaret Bourke – 1946</strong></h2><p>First of all we need to understand the importance of the spinning wheel, since one can just look at the image and state “why is it iconic?” The spinning wheel was the strongest symbol for India’s struggle and desire for independence from the United Kingdom. Gandhi was near one and the composition seemed appropriate, but Gandhi’s secretaries stopped her, and told her that if she was going to make the image, with that precise composition, she had to learn how to use one spinning wheel herself.</p><p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-2GqZ667/0/O/i-2GqZ667.jpg\" alt=\"World Famous Photos - The Mahatma - By Margaret Bourke – 1946\" height=\"559\" width=\"766\">© Margaret Bourke</p><p>If Margaret Bourke didn’t had the social skills to accept the traditions and respect for the cultural demands, the image simply wouldn’t have happened at all.</p><p>LIFE magazine’s first woman photographer was in India in 1946 covering the Indian independence process.</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Tank Man – Jeff Widener – 1989</strong></h2><p>Still with his identity uncertain, the picture of the anonymous protestor of Tiananmen Square. The background of the picture is the following. When the Chinese military convoyed into Beijing, the one-man army individual opposed the long column of tanks that were rumbling into the area.</p><p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-Lz8j5CT/0/L/i-Lz8j5CT-L.jpg\" alt=\"World Famous Photos - Tank Man - Jeff Widener – 1989\" height=\"539\" width=\"800\">© Jeff Widener</p><p>The pictured was captured from pretty far away from a hotel room by Jeff Widener, and we can see him talking about the image’s context here:</p><p>Fortunately the tank driver was compassionate and stopped, because something like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3698842/Turkish-protester-run-tank-TWICE-manages-feet-failed-coup.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(170, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">that</a>happened a few months back in Turkey, and the drivers weren’t so human like the Chinese. Even though images keep reminding us about the atrocities that must not be done, there are still work to do in order to sensibilize the human race to avoid this kind of events in the future.</p><p>The image shows the great power protesting can have.</p>

All of you who bought or read or helped to tirelessly promote Flight and our work, you were the ones that made it such a great experience. We all put in the sweat and love to get this project off the ground, and we saw that reflected in the amazing support for (what started as) our fun “little” project.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">So, um, where was I?

Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to let rest for 4 hours.\\</p><p><br></p><p>2. Make the angel food cake: Heat oven to 325°. Line bottom of a 10\" round cake pan with ungreased parchment paper. In a medium bowl, sift together confectioners' sugar and flour; set flour mixture aside. In a large bowl, beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt with a handheld mixer on low speed until frothy. Increase mixer speed to medium, sprinkle in sugar, vanilla, and almond extract, and beat until stiff peaks form. Sprinkle half of the confectioners' sugar-flour mixture over egg whites; using a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://i.viglink.com/?key=b33c9a8db7a61caeec247e8778c24aa1&amp;insertId=912be57ada75388e&amp;type=CD&amp;exp=-100%3ACILITE%3A1&amp;libId=jpuac1hk01011mhe000DAw8qmxfckdc0u&amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.saveur.com%2Farticle%2FRecipes%2FHeaven-and-Hell-Cake&amp;v=1&amp;iid=912be57ada75388e&amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_nkw%3Drubber%2Bspatula&amp;title=Heaven%20and%20Hell%20Cake%20Recipe%20%7C%20SAVEUR&amp;txt=%3Cspan%3Erubber%20%3C%2Fspan%3E%3Cspan%3Espatula%3C%2Fspan%3E\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(35, 31, 32);\">rubber&nbsp;spatula</a>, fold until just combined. Repeat with remaining flour mixture. Pour batter into prepared cake pan and bake until top of cake springs back when touched, 45-50 minutes. Transfer cake to a rack and let cool.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Make the devil's food cake: Heat oven to 350°. Grease a 10\" round cake pan with shortening and dust with flour to coat; shake out excess flour and set pan aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together cake flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder; set flour mixture aside. In another medium bowl, whisk the coffee and cocoa powder until smooth; set coffee mixture aside. In a large bowl, beat the shortening, sugar, vanilla, and eggs with a handheld mixer on medium speed until pale and fluffy, 2 minutes. Alternately add the flour mixture and the coffee mixture to the bowl in 3 stages, beating to combine after each addition. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean, 30-35 minutes; transfer to a rack and let cool completely.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Make the peanut butter mousse: In a large bowl, beat cream cheese, peanut butter, and confectioners' sugar with a handheld mixer on medium speed until smooth and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Put cream into a large bowl and beat on high speed until stiff peaks form. Using a&nbsp;rubber spatula, fold the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture; set mousse aside in the refrigerator.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>5. Assemble the cake: Using a serrated-blade knife, slice each cake horizontally into 2 layers. Place 1 layer of the devil's food cake on a cake stand and spread 1/3 of the peanut butter mousse over the top with a butter knife. Top mousse with a layer of the angel food cake and spread with half of the remaining mousse. Repeat with the remaining devil's food cake, mousse, and angel food cake. Wrap cake in plastic wrap and freeze for 2 hours. Stir ganache until smooth and spread evenly over the top and sides of the cake with a butter knife. Refrigerate the cake for 2 hours before slicing.</p><p><br></p><p>SERVES 10 - 12</p><p><br></p><iframe class=\"ql-video\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x1egfjl?autoplay=false&amp;mute=false&amp;ui-start_screen_info=true&amp;endscreen-enable=true&amp;start=&amp;sharing-enable=true&amp;ui-logo=true&amp;ui-theme=dark&amp;controls=true&amp;ui-highlight=\"></iframe><p><br></p><p><strong>Tags:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/tags/desserts\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(35, 31, 32);\">Desserts</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/tags/american\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(35, 31, 32);\">American</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/tags/medium\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(35, 31, 32);\">Medium</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/tags/nuts\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(35, 31, 32);\">Nuts</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/tags/baking\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(35, 31, 32);\">Bake</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/tags/chocolate\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(35, 31, 32);\">Chocolate</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/tags/summer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(35, 31, 32);\">Summer</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/tags/recipes\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(35, 31, 32);\">Recipes</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/tags/entertaining\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(35, 31, 32);\">Entertaining</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/tags/issue-121\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(35, 31, 32);\">Issue 121</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saveur.com/tags/cakes\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(35, 31, 32);\">Cakes</a>&nbsp;</p>

Note that the cowl neck and the sweater body are a connected piece of fabric. The total length of mine was 138cm (cowl). When you are cutting a side with the fold be sure to half the dimension.</p><p>I used a sweater that I have that fits me to get the width of the sweater body. I took a measuring tape and using a mirror decided what measurement I wanted for the length of the sweater, from my shoulder to above my knees (I wanted the sweater long enough to be pants-optional).</p><p>For the width of the cowl neck, I measured on my shoulders how wide I wanted the neckline to open up. For the length of the cowl neck, I wanted the zipper of the sweater hang in the middle of my face, so I measured from the nape of my neck over the back of my head to my nose.</p><p>Note that you will be cutting a shoulder where the cowl meets the sweater body. My cowl width is 26cm and my sweater body width is 40cm, so my shoulder width is 7cm on each shoulder. I gave my shoulders a slight slope to match the sweater I had that fit me.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">Add TipAsk QuestionCommentDownload</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Step 2: Measure and Cut Sweater Sleeves</strong></h2><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FS6/5HDV/IXAQ3XXS/FS65HDVIXAQ3XXS.LARGE.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(232, 108, 0);\"><img src=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FS6/5HDV/IXAQ3XXS/FS65HDVIXAQ3XXS.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=900&amp;crop=3:2\" alt=\"Picture of Measure and Cut Sweater Sleeves\"></a></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/F68/VLVT/IXAQ3XY9/F68VLVTIXAQ3XY9.LARGE.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(232, 108, 0);\"><img src=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/F68/VLVT/IXAQ3XY9/F68VLVTIXAQ3XY9.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=300&amp;crop=3:2\" alt=\"Picture of Measure and Cut Sweater Sleeves\"></a></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FII/106L/IXAQ3XYA/FII106LIXAQ3XYA.LARGE.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(232, 108, 0);\"><img src=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FII/106L/IXAQ3XYA/FII106LIXAQ3XYA.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=300&amp;crop=3:2\" alt=\"Picture of Measure and Cut Sweater Sleeves\"></a></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FK9/LP6K/IXAQ3XYD/FK9LP6KIXAQ3XYD.LARGE.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(232, 108, 0);\"><img src=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FK9/LP6K/IXAQ3XYD/FK9LP6KIXAQ3XYD.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=300&amp;crop=3:2\" alt=\"Picture of Measure and Cut Sweater Sleeves\"></a></p><p>If you want to cut both sleeves at the same time, place two pieces of fabric folded in half such that the fold is on the top edge. Use your sweater as a template to decide what size to cut the sleeves. Cut your sleeves a couple inches longer than you want the final length to be, so you have enough fabric for the hem, and leave a 1/2 inch seam allowance. If your fabric has a pattern or print (for example mine is ribbed), make sure that the direction of the pattern on the sleeves matches the direction of the pattern on the body when you are wearing the sweater and your arms are down.</p><p>I cut my sleeves 73cm long, and the wrist edge measured 12cm (so the diameter would be 24cm). The shoulder edge measured 27cm (diameter 54cm).</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">Add TipAsk QuestionCommentDownload</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Step 3: Sew Neck</strong></h2><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ5/D3GF/IXAQ3WP3/FJ5D3GFIXAQ3WP3.LARGE.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(232, 108, 0);\"><img src=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ5/D3GF/IXAQ3WP3/FJ5D3GFIXAQ3WP3.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=394\" alt=\"Picture of Sew Neck\"></a></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FYN/E5LU/IXAQ3WPZ/FYNE5LUIXAQ3WPZ.LARGE.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(232, 108, 0);\"><img src=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FYN/E5LU/IXAQ3WPZ/FYNE5LUIXAQ3WPZ.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=394\" alt=\"Picture of Sew Neck\"></a></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FO1/OYZY/IXAQ3WQJ/FO1OYZYIXAQ3WQJ.LARGE.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(232, 108, 0);\"><img src=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FO1/OYZY/IXAQ3WQJ/FO1OYZYIXAQ3WQJ.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=394\" alt=\"Picture of Sew Neck\"></a></p><p>We are attaching the front and the back pieces above where your arms would be. Pin and sew from the top of the neck down to the edge of the shoulder on the right and the left side. I used the widest zig zag stitch on my machine (7mm wide) and a 1.5 or 2mm stitch length.</p><p>Sometimes I'm super lazy and don't pin my fabric before sewing it, but that's a terrible idea with stretchy fabric like this. You may find that sometimes you have to be careful to make sure that the top piece of fabric is feeding into the sewing machine as fast as your bottom piece. I was able to do this by stretching my fabric a little when I was feeding it into the machine. If you have a lot of trouble, the internet recommends a walking foot attachment for your machine.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">Add TipAsk QuestionCommentDownload</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Step 4: Attach Sleeves</strong></h2><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FZY/PSE0/IXAQ3WJQ/FZYPSE0IXAQ3WJQ.LARGE.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(232, 108, 0);\"><img src=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FZY/PSE0/IXAQ3WJQ/FZYPSE0IXAQ3WJQ.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=600&amp;crop=3:2\" alt=\"Picture of Attach Sleeves\"></a></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FTZ/KJ28/IXAQ3WJW/FTZKJ28IXAQ3WJW.LARGE.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(232, 108, 0);\"><img src=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FTZ/KJ28/IXAQ3WJW/FTZKJ28IXAQ3WJW.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=600&amp;crop=3:2\" alt=\"Picture of Attach Sleeves\"></a></p><p>Pin and sew to attach the shoulder part of the sleeve to the shoulder part of the sweater, leaving the under arm part open.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">Add TipAsk QuestionCommentDownload</p><h2 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Step 5: Sew Sides</strong></h2><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FWN/N20D/IXAQ3WCY/FWNN20DIXAQ3WCY.LARGE.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(232, 108, 0);\"><img src=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FWN/N20D/IXAQ3WCY/FWNN20DIXAQ3WCY.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=873&amp;crop=3:2\" alt=\"Picture of Sew Sides\"></a></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/3R63/IXAQ3WD3/FTY3R63IXAQ3WD3.LARGE.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(232, 108, 0);\"><img src=\"https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/3R63/IXAQ3WD3/FTY3R63IXAQ3WD3.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=327\" alt=\"Picture of Sew Sides\"></a></p><p>I used to sew the bottom of my sleeves and the sides of my clothing separately, but I learned from withwendy on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/user/withwendy) that it's much easier to get the armpit seams to line up nicely if you sew it all in one go.

<p>Jobs was born in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 0, 128); background-color: initial;\">San Francisco</a>, California, and put up for adoption.

<p>Apple merged with NeXT in 1997, and Jobs became CEO of his former company within a few months. He was largely responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been at the verge of bankruptcy.

<p class="dropcap">Mr. John Ziegler, thirty-seven, late of Louisville's WHAS, is now on the air, "Live and Local," from 10:00 <span style="text-transform: uppercase">p.m</span>. to 1:00 <span style="text-transform: uppercase">a.m.</span> every weeknight on southern California's KFI, a 50,000-watt megastation whose hourly <a class="orange annotation-link" data-annotation="1" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation1" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'303812'">ID and Sweeper,</a><span class="orange annotation" data-annotation="1" id="annotation1" style="display: none;"> <span class="orange1">FCC regulations require a station ID to be broadcast every hour. This ID comprises a station's call letters, band and frequency, and the radio market it's licensed to serve. Just about every serious commercial station (which KFI very much is) appends to its ID a Sweeper, which is the little <a class="orange annotation-link" data-annotation="2" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation2" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'303812'">tag line</a><span class="orange annotation" data-annotation="2" id="annotation2" style="display: none;"> <span class="orange1">There are also separate, subsidiary tag lines that KFI develops specially for its local programs. The main two it's using for the <i>John Ziegler Show</i> so far are "Live and Local" and "Hot, Fresh Talk Served Nightly."</span> </span> by which the station wishes to be known. KABC, the other giant AM talk station in Los Angeles, deploys the entendre-rich "Where America Comes First." KFI's own main Sweeper is "More <i>Stimulating</i> Talk Radio," but it's also got secondary Sweepers that it uses to intro the half-hour news, traffic updates at seventeen and forty-six past the hour, and station promos. "Southern California's Newsroom," "The Radio Home of Fox News," and "When You See News Break, Don't Try to Fix It Yourself—Leave That to Professionals" are the big three that KFI's running this spring. The content and sound of all IDs, Sweepers, and promos are the responsibility of the station's Imaging department, apparently so named because they involve KFI's image in the LA market. Imaging is sort of the radio version of branding—the Sweepers let KFI communicate its special personality and 'tude in a compressed way. </span> </span> designed by the station's Imaging department and featuring a gravelly basso <a class="green annotation-link" data-annotation="3" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation3" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'303812'">whisper</a><span class="green annotation" data-annotation="3" id="annotation3" style="display: none;"> <span class="green1">The whisperer turns out to be one Chris Corley, a voiceover actor best known for movie trailers. Corley's C2 Productions is based in Fort Myers FL. </span> </span> against licks from Ratt's 1984 metal classic "Round and Round," is "KFI AM-640, Los Angeles—More <i>Stimulating</i> Talk Radio." This is either the eighth or ninth host job that Mr. Ziegler's had in his talk-radio career, and far and away the biggest. He moved out here to LA over Christmas—alone, towing a U-Haul—and found an apartment not far from KFI's studios, which are in an old part of the Koreatown district, near Wilshire Center.</p>

<p>The <i>John Ziegler Show</i> is the first local, nonsyndicated late-night program that KFI has aired in a long time. It's something of a gamble for everyone involved. Ten o'clock to one qualifies as late at night in southern California, where hardly anything reputable's open after nine.</p>

<p>It is currently right near the end of the program's second segment on the evening of May 11, 2004, shortly after Nicholas Berg's taped beheading by an al-Qaeda splinter in Iraq. Dressed, as is his custom, for golf, and wearing a white-billed cap w/ corporate logo, Mr. Ziegler is seated by himself in the on-air studio, surrounded by monitors and sheaves of Internet downloads. He is trim, clean-shaven, and <a class="red annotation-link" data-annotation="4" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation4" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'303812'">handsome in the somewhat bland way</a><span class="red annotation" data-annotation="4" id="annotation4" style="display: none;"> <span class="red1">(By the standards of the U.S. radio industry this makes him almost movie-star gorgeous.) </span> </span> that top golfers and local TV newsmen tend to be. His eyes, which off-air are usually flat and unhappy, are alight now with passionate conviction. Only some of the studio's monitors concern Mr. Z.'s own program; the ones up near the ceiling take muted, closed-caption feeds from Fox News, MSNBC, and what might be C-<span style="text-transform: uppercase">SPAN</span>. To his big desk's upper left is a wall-mounted digital clock that counts down seconds. His computer monitors' displays also show the exact time.</p>

<p>Across the soundproof glass of the opposite wall, another monitor in the Airmix room is running an episode of <i>The Simpsons</i>, also muted, which both the board op and the call screener are watching with half an eye.</p>

<p>Pendent in front of John Ziegler's face, attached to the same type of hinged, flexible stand as certain student desk lamps, is a Shure-brand broadcast microphone that is sheathed in a gray foam filtration sock to soften popped p's and hissed sibilants. It is into this microphone that the host speaks:</p>

<p>"And I'll tell you why—it's because we're <i>better</i> than they are."</p>

<p>A Georgetown B.A. in government and philosophy, scratch golfer, former TV sportscaster, possible world-class authority on the O.J. Simpson trial, and sometime contributor to MSNBC's <i>Scarborough Country</i>, Mr. Ziegler is referring here to America versus what he terms "the Arab world." It's near the end of his "churn," which is the industry term for a host's opening monologue, whose purpose is both to introduce a show's nightly topics and to get listeners emotionally stimulated enough that they're drawn into the program and don't switch away. More than any other mass medium, radio enjoys a captive audience—if only because so many of the listeners are driving—but in a major market there are dozens of AM stations to listen to, plus of course FM and satellite radio, and even a very seductive and successful station rarely gets more than a five or six percent audience share.</p>

<p>"We're not perfect, we suck a lot of the time, but we are <i>better</i> as a people, as a culture, and as a society than they are, and we need to recognize that, so that we can possibly even <i>begin</i> to deal with the evil that we are facing."</p>

<p>When Mr. Z.'s impassioned, his voice rises and his arms wave around (which obviously only those in the Airmix room can see). He also fidgets, bobs slightly up and down in his executive desk chair, and weaves. Although he must stay seated and can't pace around the room, the host does not have to keep his mouth any set distance from the microphone, since the board op, 'Mondo Hernandez, can adjust his levels on the mixing board's channel 7 so that Mr. Z.'s volume always stays in range and never peaks or fades. 'Mondo, whose price for letting outside parties hang around Airmix is one large bag of cool-ranch Doritos per evening, is an immense twenty-one-year-old man with a ponytail, stony Mesoamerican features, and the placid, grandmotherly eyes common to giant mammals everywhere. Keeping the studio signal from <a class="purple annotation-link" data-annotation="5" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation5" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'303812'">peaking</a><span class="purple annotation" data-annotation="5" id="annotation5" style="display: none;"> <span class="purple1">'Mondo's lay explanation of what peaking is consists of pointing at the red area to the right of the two volumeters' bobbing needles on the mixing board: "It's when the needles go into the red." The overall mission, apparently, is to keep the volume and resonance of a host's voice high enough to be stimulating but not so high that they exceed the capacities of an AM analog signal or basic radio receiver. <a class="purple annotation-link" data-annotation="6" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation6" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'303812'">One reason</a><span class="purple annotation" data-annotation="6" id="annotation6" style="display: none;"> <span class="purple1">Another reason is mike processing, which evens and fills out the host's voice, removing raspy or metallic tones, and occurs automatically in Airmix. There's no such processing for the callers' voices. </span> </span> why callers' voices sound so much less rich and authoritative than hosts' voices on talk radio is that it is harder to keep telephone voices from peaking. </span> </span> is one of 'Mondo's prime directives, along with making sure that each of the program's scheduled commercial spots is loaded into <a class="chartreuse annotation-link" data-annotation="7" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation7" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'303812'">Prophet</a><span class="chartreuse annotation" data-annotation="7" id="annotation7" style="display: none;"> <span class="chartreuse1">Prophet is the special OS for KFI's computer system—"like Windows for a radio station," according to Mr. Ziegler's producer. </span> </span> and run at just the right time, whereupon he must confirm that the ad has run as scheduled in the special Airmix log he signs each page of, so that the station can bill advertisers for their spots. 'Mondo, who started out two years ago as an unpaid intern and now earns ten dollars an hour, works 7:00—1:00 on weeknights and also board-ops KFI's special cooking show on Sundays.

As is SOP in political talk radio, the emotions most readily accessed are anger, outrage, indignation, fear, despair, disgust, contempt, and a certain kind of <a class="pink annotation-link" data-annotation="8" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation8" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'303812'">apocalyptic glee,</a><span class="pink annotation" data-annotation="8" id="annotation8" style="display: none;"> <span class="pink1">Here is a sample bit of "What the <i>John Ziegler Show</i> is All About," a long editorial intro to the program that Mr. Ziegler delivered snippets of over his first several nights in January: </span><blockquote>The underlying premise of the <i>John Ziegler Show</i> is that, thanks to its socialistic leanings, incompetent media, eroding moral foundation, aging demographics, and undereducated masses, the United States, as we know it, is doomed. In my view, we don't know how much longer we still have to enjoy it, so we shouldn't waste precious moments constantly worrying or complaining about it. However, because not everyone in this country is yet convinced of this seemingly obvious reality, the show does see merit in pointing out or documenting the demise of our nation and will take great pains to do so. And because most everyone can agree that there is value in attempting to delay the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i> as long as possible, whenever feasible the <i>John Ziegler Show</i> will attempt to do its part to plug whatever holes in the ship it can. With that said, the show realizes that, no matter how successful it (or anyone else) may be in slowing the downfall of our society, the final outcome is still pretty much inevitable, so we might as well have a good time watching the place fall to pieces.</blockquote> Be advised that the intro's stilted, term-paperish language, which looks kind of awful in print, is a great deal more effective when the spiel is delivered out loud—the stiffness gives it a slight air of self-mockery that keeps you from being totally sure just how seriously John Ziegler takes what he's saying. Meaning he gets to have it both ways. This half-pretend pretension, which is ingenious in all sorts of ways, was pioneered in talk radio by Rush Limbaugh, although with Limbaugh the semi—self-mockery is more tonal than syntactic. </span> all of which the Nick Berg thing's got in spades. Mr. Ziegler, whose program is in only its fourth month at KFI, has been fortunate in that 2004 has already been chock-full of Monsters—Saddam's detention, the Abu Ghraib scandal, the Scott Peterson murder trial, the Greg Haidl gang-rape trial, and preliminary hearings in the rape trial of Kobe Bryant. But tonight is the most angry, indignant, disgusted, and impassioned that Mr. Z.'s gotten on-air so far, and the consensus in Airmix is that it's resulting in some absolutely first-rate talk radio.</p>

<p>John Ziegler, who is a talk-radio host of unflagging industry, broad general knowledge, mordant wit, and extreme conviction, makes a particular specialty of media criticism. One object of his disgust and contempt in the churn so far has been the U.S. networks' spineless, patronizing decision not to air the Berg videotape and thus to deny Americans "a true and accurate view of the barbarity, the utter <i>depravity</i>, of these people." Even more outrageous, to Mr. Z., is the mainstream media's lack of outrage about Berg's taped murder versus all that same media's hand-wringing and invective over the recent photos of alleged prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison, which he views as a clear indication of the deluded, blame-America-first mentality of the U.S. press. It is an associated contrast between Americans' mortified response to the Abu Ghraib photos and reports of the Arab world's phlegmatic reaction to the Berg video that leads to his churn's climax, which is that we are plainly, unambiguously better than the Arab world—whereupon John Ziegler invites listeners to respond if they are so moved, repeats the special mnemonic KFI call-in number, and breaks for the :30 news and ads, on time to the second, as 'Mondo takes <a class="blue annotation-link" data-annotation="9" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation9" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'303812'">ISDN feed from Airwatch</a><span class="blue annotation" data-annotation="9" id="annotation9" style="display: none;"> <span class="blue1">ISDN, in which the D stands for "Digital," is basically a phone line of very high quality and expense. ISDN is the main way that stations take feed for syndicated programs from companies like Infinity Broadcasting, Premiere Radio Networks, etc. KFI has its own News department and traffic reporters, but on nights and weekends it subscribes to an independent service called Airwatch that provides off-hour news and traffic for stations in the LA area. When, at :17 and :46 every hour, Mr. Z. intros a report from "Alan LaGreen in the KFI Traffic Center," it's really Alan LaGreen of Airwatch, who's doing ISDN traffic reports for different stations at different times all hour and has to be very careful to give the right call letters for the Traffic Center he's supposedly reporting from.</span> </span> and the program's associate producer and call screener, Vince Nicholas—twenty-six and hiply bald—pushes back from his console and raises both arms in congratulation, through the glass.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It goes without saying that there are all different kinds of stimulation. Depending on one's politics, sensitivities, and tastes in argumentation, it is not hard to think of objections to John Ziegler's climactic claim, or at least of some urgent requests for clarification. Like: Exactly what and whom does "the Arab world" refer to? And why are a few editorials and man-on-the-street interviews sufficient to represent the attitude and character of a whole diverse region? And why is al-Jazeera's showing of the Berg video so awful if Mr. Z. has just castigated the U.S. networks for <i>not</i> showing it? Plus, of course, what is "better" supposed to mean here? More moral? More diffident about our immorality? Is it not, in our own history, pretty easy to name some Berg-level atrocities committed by U.S. nationals, or agencies, or even governments, and approved by much of our populace? Or perhaps this: Leaving aside whether John Ziegler's assertions are true or coherent, is it even remotely helpful or productive to make huge, sweeping claims about some other region's/culture's inferiority to us? What possible effect can such remarks have except to incite hatred? Aren't they sort of irresponsible?</p>

<p>It is true that no one on either side of the studio's thick window expresses or even alludes to any of these objections. But this is not because Mr. Z.'s support staff is stupid, or hateful, or even necessarily on board with sweeping jingoistic claims. It is because they understand the particular codes and imperatives of large-market talk radio. The fact of the matter is that it is not John Ziegler's job to be responsible, or nuanced, or to think about whether his on-air comments are productive or dangerous, or cogent, or even defensible. That is not to say that the host would not defend his "we're better"—strenuously—or that he does not believe it's true. It is to say that he has exactly one on-air job, and that is to be <a class="orange annotation-link" data-annotation="10" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation10" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'14',r'303812'">stimulating.</a><span class="orange annotation" data-annotation="10" id="annotation10" style="display: none;"> <span class="orange1">KFI management's explanation of "stimulating" is apposite, if a bit slippery. Following is an excerpted transcript of a May 25 Q &amp; A with Ms. Robin Bertolucci, the station's intelligent, highly successful, and sort of hypnotically intimidating Program Director. (The haphazard start is because the interviewing skills behind the Q parts are marginal; the excerpt gets more interesting as it goes along.)<br>
     Q: Is there some compact way to describe KFI's programming philosophy?<br>
     A: "What we call ourselves is 'More Stimulating Talk Radio.'"<br>
     Q: Pretty much got that part already.<br>
     A: "That is the slogan that we try to express every minute on the air. Of being stimulating. Being informative, being entertaining, being energetic, being dynamic … The way we do it is a marriage of information and stimulating entertainment."<br>
     Q: What exactly is it that makes information entertaining?<br>
     A: "It's attitudinal, it's emotional."<br>
     Q: Can you explain this attitudinal component?<br>
     A: "I think 'stimulating' really sums it up. It's what we really try to do."<br>
     Q: [strangled frustration noises]<br>
     A: "Look, our station logo is in orange and black, and white—it's a stark, aggressive look. I think that typifies it. The attitude. A little in-your-face. We're not … stodgy."</span> </span> An obvious point, but it's one that's often overlooked by people who complain about propaganda, misinformation, and irresponsibility in commercial talk radio. Whatever else they are, the above-type objections to "We're better than the Arab world" are calls to accountability. They are the sort of criticisms one might make of, say, a journalist, someone whose job description includes being responsible about what he says in public. And KFI's John Ziegler is not a journalist—he is <a class="green annotation-link" data-annotation="11" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation11" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'15',r'303812'">an entertainer.</a><span class="green annotation" data-annotation="11" id="annotation11" style="display: none;"> <span class="green1">See, e.g., Mr. John Kobylt, of KFI's top-rated afternoon <i>John &amp; Ken Show</i>, in a recent <i>LA Times</i> profile: "The truth is, we do everything for ratings. Yes, that's our job. I can show you the contract … This is not <i>Meet the Press</i>. It's not <i>The Jim Lehrer News Hour</i>."</span> </span> Or maybe it's better to say that he is part of a peculiar, <a class="red annotation-link" data-annotation="12" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation12" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'16',r'303812'">modern,</a><span class="red annotation" data-annotation="12" id="annotation12" style="display: none;"> <span class="red1">Or you could call it atavistic, a throwback. The truth is that what we think of as objectivity in journalism has been a standard since only the 1900s, and mainly in the United States. Have a look at some European dailies sometime.</span> </span> and very popular type of news industry, one that manages to enjoy the authority and influence of journalism without the stodgy constraints of fairness, objectivity, and responsibility that make trying to tell the truth such a drag for everyone involved. It is a frightening industry, though not for any of the simple reasons most critics give.</p>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

<p class="dropcap">Distributed over two walls of KFI's broadcast studio, behind the monitors and clocks, are a dozen promotional KFI posters, all in the station's eye-catching <a class="purple annotation-link" data-annotation="13" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation13" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'17',r'303812'">Halloween colors against the Sweeper's bright white.</a><span class="purple annotation" data-annotation="13" id="annotation13" style="display: none;"> <span class="purple1">KFI has large billboards at traffic nodes all over metro Los Angeles with the same general look and feel, although the billboards often carry both the Sweeper and extra tag phrases—"Raving Infomaniacs," "The Death of Ignorance," "The Straight Poop," and (against a military-camouflage background) "Intelligence Briefings."</span> </span> On each poster, the word "stimulating" is both italicized and underscored. Except for the door and soundproof window, the entire studio is lined in acoustic tile with strange Pollockian patterns of tiny holes. Much of the tile is grayed and decaying, and the carpet's no color at all; KFI has been in this facility for nearly thirty years and will soon be moving out. Both the studio and Airmix are kept chilly because of all the electronics. The overhead lights are old inset fluorescents, the kind with the slight flutter to them; nothing casts any sort of shadow. On one of the studio walls is also pinned the <a class="chartreuse annotation-link" data-annotation="14" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation14" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'18',r'303812'">special set of playing cards</a><span class="chartreuse annotation" data-annotation="14" id="annotation14" style="display: none;"> <span class="chartreuse1">The Airmix room's analogue to the cards is a bumper sticker next to the producer's station: </span><blockquote>WHO WOULD THE FRENCH VOTE FOR?<br>
—<i>AMERICANS FOR BUSH</i></blockquote> </span> distributed for the invasion of Iraq, these with hand-drawn Xs over the faces of those Baathists captured or killed so far. The great L-shaped table that Mr. Z. sits at nearly fills the little room; it's got so many coats of brown paint on it that the tabletop looks slightly humped. At the L's base is another Shure microphone, used by Ken Chiampou of 3:00—7:00's <i>John &amp; Ken</i>, its hinged stand now partly folded up so that the mike hangs like a wilted flower. The oddest thing about the studio is a strong scent of decaying bananas, as if many peels or even whole bananas were rotting in the room's wastebaskets, none of which look to have been emptied anytime recently. Mr. Ziegler, who has his <a class="pink annotation-link" data-annotation="15" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/303812/#annotation15" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'19',r'303812'">ascetic</a><span class="pink annotation" data-annotation="15" id="annotation15" style="display: none;"> <span class="pink1">(He never leaves his chair during breaks, for example, not even to use the restroom.)</span> </span> side, drinks only bottled water in the studio, and certainly never snacks, so there is no way he is the source of the banana smell.</p>
